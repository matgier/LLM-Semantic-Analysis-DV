      Simply put, it is too hard to raise young children in America today while
      also working. Improving support for working families with young children
      is at the forefront of our national conversation. Most parents are in the
      labor force; however, workplaces and government policies have not caught
      up to help support working families in today’s environment. The need for
      consensus solutions is more relevant now than ever with historically high

      As a whole, Democrats are widely concerned about climate change and
      closely follow science to remain informed about the ongoing development of
      global warming – especially as the IPCC issued in their most recent report
      that much of climate change has been aggravated by excessive human
      activity – such as mass production and increased levels of use in
      unsustainable transportation. In fact, addressing climate change is a
      pivotal topic in many agendas for those who identify with the Democratic
      party. This is because Democrats hold tight to the belief that climate
      change presents a threat to society, the economy, and the future health of
      Americans.

      In addition to this, many Democrats view the transition to the use of
      clean energy and a clean economy as an opportunity to only help the
      environment out of peril, but to curate new job opportunities for
      Americans as well to help stimulate the economy and ensure people are

      Building a 100 percent clean energy economy requires clear goals to guide
      its critical decisions. The Biden administration is the first to embrace
      the goal of reaching net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by midcentury in
      order to stabilize global temperatures at 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming.*
      That means that the Biden administration’s interim target—cutting U.S.
      carbon pollution to half of peak levels by 2030—requires reducing annual
      carbon pollution nearly four times faster than the Obama administration’s
      interim target did.** Ambitious policy goals drive ambitious policy

      Climate change is ultimately viewed by Democrats as one of, if not the

      In the fight against climate change, Democratic AGs play a pivotal role in

      The Deocratic platform has a strong emphasis on the shift to clean energy,
      which Democrats say can also lower Americans' energy costs and create more
      jobs. Here's what the goals include: Incentivize investment in
      transmission line upgrades and new lines, which move wind and solar energy
      from where they're generated to where people live. Scale up development of
      clean energy on public lands. Invest in clean energy research and

      In April 2021, Biden set a new national goal to reduce emissions by 50% to
      52% from 2005 levels by 2030, formalizing it in an updated nationally
      determined contribution (NDC) under the Paris Agreement. Achieving this
      goal will be a challenge, but it remains within reach thanks to progress
      made in 2022 (see #2). The administration must develop a 2035 emissions
      reduction target by next year, as required by the United Nations Framework
      Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), that builds upon the United States’
      2030 goal.

      Among all registered voters, climate change is 19th out of 28 issues this

      New Democrats are committed to advancing real solutions that reduce health

      encourage participation by the young and healthy. To stabilize health
      insurance markets and bring down the cost of healthcare for all Americans,
      New Dems believe we must create a permanent reinsurance program, reduce
      healthcare costs for low-income Americans, promote greater insurance
      coverage, create a greater number of affordable insurance options, and
      improve the marketplaces. New Democrats have sought ways to work with

      DFLA is committed to expanding access to health care. Our members take a
