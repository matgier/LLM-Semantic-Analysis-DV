      New Democrats are committed to advancing real solutions that reduce health
      care costs for families and seniors, increase choices for consumers, and
      encourage participation by the young and healthy. To stabilize health
      insurance markets and bring down the cost of healthcare for all Americans,
      New Dems believe we must create a permanent reinsurance program, reduce
      healthcare costs for low-income Americans, promote greater insurance
      coverage, create a greater number of affordable insurance options, and
      improve the marketplaces. New Democrats have sought ways to work with
      Republicans for years to fix what is not working and strengthen the ACA,
      but Republican actions continue to raise questions about their commitment
      to join these efforts.

      In April 2021, Biden set a new national goal to reduce emissions by 50% to
      52% from 2005 levels by 2030, formalizing it in an updated nationally
      determined contribution (NDC) under the Paris Agreement. Achieving this
      goal will be a challenge, but it remains within reach thanks to progress
      made in 2022 (see #2). The administration must develop a 2035 emissions
      reduction target by next year, as required by the United Nations Framework
      Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), that builds upon the United States’
      2030 goal.

      House Republicans are proposing legislation that would reduce federal
      taxes by $3.8 trillion over 10 years, with a disproportionate share of tax
      breaks going to the wealthy. The legislation would partially offset that
      revenue loss with reduced spending of $1.1 trillion over 10 years—$1.5
      trillion in spending cuts that include deep and harmful cuts to nutrition
      assistance and health care for low-income households,
