      Furthermore, Democrats to some degree support government-funded healthcare
      and the party thereby aims to ensure that health and social services are
      accessible for all U.S. citizens. Additionally, the Democratic Party
      generally supports women’s legal rights to free abortion as well as LGBTQ+
      people’s rights to equal treatment under the law. In opposition to
      Republicans a large part of the Democratic Party promotes a tightening of
      gun legislation and dispute the right to carry a concealed weapon (as
      opposed to open carry). Similar to the Republican Party, Democrats
      advocate for religious freedom and individuals’ right to practice their
      faith. However, at the same time, and generally more so than Republicans,
      Democrats value a separation between church and state, as is stated in the
      U.S. constitution

      As a whole, Democrats are widely concerned about climate change and
      closely follow science to remain informed about the ongoing development of
      global warming – especially as the IPCC issued in their most recent report
      that much of climate change has been aggravated by excessive human
      activity – such as mass production and increased levels of use in
      unsustainable transportation. In fact, addressing climate change is a
      pivotal topic in many agendas for those who identify with the Democratic
      party. This is because Democrats hold tight to the belief that climate
      change presents a threat to society, the economy, and the future health of
      Americans.

      The Deocratic platform has a strong emphasis on the shift to clean energy,
      which Democrats say can also lower Americans' energy costs and create more
      jobs. Here's what the goals include: Incentivize investment in
      transmission line upgrades and new lines, which move wind and solar energy
      from where they're generated to where people live. Scale up development of
      clean energy on public lands. Invest in clean energy research and
      innovation.

      In April 2021, Biden set a new national goal to reduce emissions by 50% to
      52% from 2005 levels by 2030, formalizing it in an updated nationally
      determined contribution (NDC) under the Paris Agreement. Achieving this
      goal will be a challenge, but it remains within reach thanks to progress
      made in 2022 (see #2). The administration must develop a 2035 emissions
      reduction target by next year, as required by the United Nations Framework
      Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), that builds upon the United States’
      2030 goal.

      New Democrats are committed to advancing real solutions that reduce health
      care costs for families and seniors, increase choices for consumers, and
      encourage participation by the young and healthy. To stabilize health
      insurance markets and bring down the cost of healthcare for all Americans,
      New Dems believe we must create a permanent reinsurance program, reduce
      healthcare costs for low-income Americans, promote greater insurance
      coverage, create a greater number of affordable insurance options, and
      improve the marketplaces. New Democrats have sought ways to work with
      Republicans for years to fix what is not working and strengthen the ACA,
      but Republican actions continue to raise questions about their commitment
      to join these efforts.

      those designed to prevent discrimination. Those claims have not been

      discriminate on religious grounds even when hiring staff to fulfill
      government grants. Moreover, institutions have insisted that they be

      House Republicans are proposing legislation that would reduce federal
      taxes by $3.8 trillion over 10 years, with a disproportionate share of tax
      breaks going to the wealthy. The legislation would partially offset that
      revenue loss with reduced spending of $1.1 trillion over 10 years—$1.5
      trillion in spending cuts that include deep and harmful cuts to nutrition
      assistance and health care for low-income households,
