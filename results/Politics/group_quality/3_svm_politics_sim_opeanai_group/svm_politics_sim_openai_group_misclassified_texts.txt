      The first obligation of the federal government is to provide for the
      “common defense” of the United States by securing our borders and
      protecting our homeland and our strategic interests abroad. We are not
      “the world’s police force,” but because America serves in a natural role
      of moral leadership in an increasingly dangerous world, and weakness
      invites aggression, we must remain the strongest military power on
      earth—fully prepared and capable of defeating any adversaries, tyrants or
      terrorists, under any circumstances, at any time. This requires
      maintaining sufficient investments in our air, land, sea, nuclear, and
      cyber capabilities to deter foreign aggression, and properly training,
      equipping, and supporting our troops and their families, as well as our
      veterans and wounded warriors.

      Advances in personal liberty in the free world advance equality and
      inclusion; capitalism is diverse, socialism a dictatorship of conformity.
      For free-marketeers, the nostrum that diversity is an advantage is not
      only defensible but self-evident. It deserves better than to be
      surrendered as a concept and term to the identarian Left

      With rapidity and stealth, diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) ideology
      has come to replace the classical liberal values of merit, fairness and
      equality (MFE) in the academy, professional organizations, media,
      government and large technology companies. DEI bureaucracies have
      mushroomed. Many operate behind the scenes with ambiguous DEI definitions,
      goals and policies

      Liberal Democrats, by contrast, are the least supportive of these
      restrictive goals while being the most supportive of establishing a path

      If we don't have a Border, we don't have a Country. Restoring sensible
      Border Security and Immigration Policy requires many steps, all of which
      would have been and indeed were taken for granted by prior Generations as
      obviously necessary and good.

      Conservative Republicans are the most likely to express strong support for
      more restrictive immigration goals such as increased border security and

      Republicans are prioritizing the American people over the Democrat’s
      radical climate agenda. On his first day in office, President Biden
      started the war on American energy. He has revoked the permit for the
      Keystone XL pipeline, imposed a moratorium on oil production on federal
      lands, directed agencies across the Federal government to impose punitive
      and burdensome regulations, and made us more reliant on China.
      Predictably, gas prices skyrocketed to the highest levels in American
      history. People are counting on us to improve their quality of life. H.R.
      1 delivers on that promise and will ensure America continues to lead the
      world at reducing emissions. I commend the passing of this package, which
      will boost energy production, lift regulatory burdens for the construction
      of more energy infrastructure, cut China out of our critical materials
      supply chains, and lower costs across the board. H.R. 1 is how we build a
      better and more secure future for all Americans.

      Republicans often frame energy policy within the context of national
      security, emphasizing the need for a resilient and independent energy
      system. Hydropower’s ability to provide baseload power and enhance grid
      stability aligns with these goals. Moreover, its role in managing water
      resources, such as flood control, irrigation, and navigation, adds another
      layer of strategic importance.
