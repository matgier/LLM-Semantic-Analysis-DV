      The Republican Party in the Trump era remained a mostly pro-business party
      in its policies but its constituencies and rhetoric have tilted more
      working class and populist, with many Romney Republicans drifting into the
      Democratic coalition....much of corporate America has swung culturally
      into liberalism’s camp. That process was well underway a decade ago, but
      it’s been accelerated by anti-Trump backlash, the more left-leaning
      commitments of big business’s younger customers and (especially) younger
      employees, and the relative ease with which the radical-sounding language
      of identity politics can be assimilated to corporate management
      techniques. As a consequence, today’s G.O.P. is most clearly now the party
      of local capitalism — the small-business gentry, the family firms.... Much
      of the party elite wish to continue doing business with big business as
      before. But the party’s base regards corporate institutions — especially
      in Silicon Valley, but extending to more traditional capitalist powers —
      as cultural enemies, with too much consolidated power and too much
      interest in pressuring, censoring, and propagandizing against socially
      conservative views and policy

      House Republicans are proposing legislation that would reduce federal
      taxes by $3.8 trillion over 10 years, with a disproportionate share of tax
      breaks going to the wealthy. The legislation would partially offset that
      revenue loss with reduced spending of $1.1 trillion over 10 years—$1.5
      trillion in spending cuts that include deep and harmful cuts to nutrition
      assistance and health care for low-income households,

      Building a 100 percent clean energy economy requires clear goals to guide
      its critical decisions. The Biden administration is the first to embrace
      the goal of reaching net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by midcentury in
      order to stabilize global temperatures at 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming.*
      That means that the Biden administration’s interim target—cutting U.S.
      carbon pollution to half of peak levels by 2030—requires reducing annual
      carbon pollution nearly four times faster than the Obama administration’s
      interim target did.** Ambitious policy goals drive ambitious policy

      New Democrats are committed to advancing real solutions that reduce health

      DFLA is committed to expanding access to health care. Our members take a

      A majority of the party's national and state candidates are at the very

      or moral grounds. However, many hold exceptions in the case of rape,
      incest or the mother's life being at risk while others may accept
      early-stage abortions (firmly opposing partial-birth abortion still). When
      Congress voted on the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act in 2003,
      congressional Republicans voted overwhelmingly to support the ban.

      Building the wall has long been one of Trump’s signature promises, but its
      impacts beyond political symbolism are unclear. Illegal border crossings
      have plunged since Trump took office in January amid a string of orders on
      immigration, including the suspension of the asylum system. Simply ending
      asylum meant tens of thousands of people who would’ve surrendered to law

      Republican politicians are generally considered business-friendly and in

      Republicans (87% support), and as the 2023 Chicago Council Survey found,
      majorities of Republicans (79%) favor using US troops to stop immigrants
      from coming into the US from Mexico. Finally, Republicans are divided over
      whether the US should make it easier for people fleeing violence in their
      home countries to legally immigrate to the United States, with similar
