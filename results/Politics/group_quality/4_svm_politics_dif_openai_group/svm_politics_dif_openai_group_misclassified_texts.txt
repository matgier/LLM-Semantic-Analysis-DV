      The first obligation of the federal government is to provide for the
      “common defense” of the United States by securing our borders and
      protecting our homeland and our strategic interests abroad. We are not
      “the world’s police force,” but because America serves in a natural role
      of moral leadership in an increasingly dangerous world, and weakness
      invites aggression, we must remain the strongest military power on
      earth—fully prepared and capable of defeating any adversaries, tyrants or
      terrorists, under any circumstances, at any time. This requires
      maintaining sufficient investments in our air, land, sea, nuclear, and

      veterans and wounded warriors.

      Republicans are prioritizing the American people over the Democrat’s
      radical climate agenda. On his first day in office, President Biden
      started the war on American energy. He has revoked the permit for the
      Keystone XL pipeline, imposed a moratorium on oil production on federal
      lands, directed agencies across the Federal government to impose punitive
      and burdensome regulations, and made us more reliant on China.
      Predictably, gas prices skyrocketed to the highest levels in American
      history. People are counting on us to improve their quality of life. H.R.
      1 delivers on that promise and will ensure America continues to lead the
      world at reducing emissions. I commend the passing of this package, which
      will boost energy production, lift regulatory burdens for the construction
      of more energy infrastructure, cut China out of our critical materials
      supply chains, and lower costs across the board. H.R. 1 is how we build a
      better and more secure future for all Americans.

      It is good that our leaders recognize the importance of creating a healthy
      regulatory environment, but there is plenty more work to be done. Three
      central pillars support a coherent deregulatory strategy: transparency,
      presidential control, and substantive deregulation where permitted by law.

      Republicans are more likely than Democrats to support organized prayer in
      public schools and to oppose the legal recognition of equal rights for
      gays and lesbians (see gay rights movement). Regarding foreign policy, the
      Republican Party traditionally has supported a strong national defense and
      the aggressive pursuit of U.S. national security interests, even when it
      entails acting unilaterally or in opposition to the views of the
      international community.

      Religiously affiliated institutions broadly. A wide range of religiously
      affiliated institutions have asserted that they have a legal and even
      constitutional right to be exempted from government requirements, even
      those designed to prevent discrimination. Those claims have not been
      limited to decisions in hiring ministers and others with clearly religious
      duties. Rather, institutions have often demanded that they be allowed to
      discriminate on religious grounds even when hiring staff to fulfill
      government grants. Moreover, institutions have insisted that they be
      allowed to discriminate against LGBTQ individuals in regard to employment;
      to ignore same-sex marriages in providing employee benefits; to fire
      employees who have used abortion care, contraceptives or assisted
      reproductive technology, or who have had sex or become pregnant outside of

      Building the wall has long been one of Trump’s signature promises, but its
      impacts beyond political symbolism are unclear. Illegal border crossings
      have plunged since Trump took office in January amid a string of orders on
      immigration, including the suspension of the asylum system. Simply ending
      asylum meant tens of thousands of people who would’ve surrendered to law
      enforcement instead of trying to avoid capture didn’t even attempt to
      cross. Plus, the effectiveness of border walls is hotly debated, even in
      populated areas where barriers tend to be heavily reinforced. Human

      power tools to cross walls.

      Republicans often frame energy policy within the context of national
      security, emphasizing the need for a resilient and independent energy
      system. Hydropower’s ability to provide baseload power and enhance grid
      stability aligns with these goals. Moreover, its role in managing water
      resources, such as flood control, irrigation, and navigation, adds another
      layer of strategic importance.

      Two trends make domestic production an urgent priority. The first is the
      high cost of energy, which is burdening all of us. In the last four years,
      gasoline, electricity, and natural gas prices have risen by nearly a
      third. Removing restrictions on our energy companies can bring down these
      ballooning costs

      Immigrants contribute to the strength, vitality, and dynamism of our
      communities, our economy, and our culture; America is also a sovereign
      nation whose government has the right and the duty to control our borders
      and decide who to admit. The best way to harmonize these two traditions is

      The Republican Party is often referred to as the GOP. This abbreviation
      stands for Grand Old Party. Its logo is an elephant. The Republican Party
      is known to support right-leaning ideologies of conservatism, social
      conservatism, and economic libertarianism, among other -isms. Thus,
      Republicans broadly advocate for traditional values, a low degree of
      government interference, and large support of the private sector.

      Government often stands as the greatest obstacle to the progress and
      prosperity of free people. Free markets and free trade agreements allow
      for innovation, improvement and economic expansion as risk-takers,
      entrepreneurs and business owners are given the liberty to pursue the
      American dream and create more jobs and upward mobility for more people.
      We believe competition should be encouraged, and government intervention
      and regulation should be limited. The people are better qualified to make
      decisions about their own lives and finances than bureaucrats, and the
      private sector will outperform the public sector in virtually every
      scenario. The free enterprise system rewards hard work and self-sacrifice,
      and is the basis and genius of the American economy.

      Today’s Republican party, while still claiming to stand for limited
      government, is practicing just the opposite: government intrusion

      Tennessee, Utah, Texas, Florida, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Arizona and South
      Carolina are prohibiting public schools from requiring students wear them.
      Republican states are on the way to outlawing abortions. Texas has just

      Republicans broadly favor punitive approaches to immigration policy, such
      as increasing deportations of people who are in the country illegally
      (89%) and putting more severe penalties on business for hiring people
      without legal work authorization (85%). Expanding the 700 miles of border
      wall and fencing with Mexico is also a very popular policy among
      Republicans (87% support), and as the 2023 Chicago Council Survey found,
      majorities of Republicans (79%) favor using US troops to stop immigrants
      from coming into the US from Mexico. Finally, Republicans are divided over
      whether the US should make it easier for people fleeing violence in their
      home countries to legally immigrate to the United States, with similar
      proportions supporting (49%) and opposing (50%) such a policy.
