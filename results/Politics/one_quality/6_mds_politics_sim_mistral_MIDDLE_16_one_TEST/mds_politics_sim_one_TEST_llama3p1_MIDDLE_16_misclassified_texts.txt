      Immigrants contribute to the strength, vitality, and dynamism of our

      to overhaul our system to make legal immigration work and illegal

      We define economically progressive politicians as candidates who champion
      economically progressive policies. We define progressive economic policies
      as governmental interventions on the free market that aim to reduce
      economic inequality, poverty, or increase opportunities for upward
      mobility.1 Progressive economic policies can be contrasted with
      conservative economic policies that protect the free market.

      The Republican Party in the Trump era remained a mostly pro-business party
      in its policies but its constituencies and rhetoric have tilted more
      working class and populist, with many Romney Republicans drifting into the
      Democratic coalition....much of corporate America has swung culturally
      into liberalism’s camp. That process was well underway a decade ago, but
      it’s been accelerated by anti-Trump backlash, the more left-leaning
      commitments of big business’s younger customers and (especially) younger
      employees, and the relative ease with which the radical-sounding language
      of identity politics can be assimilated to corporate management
      techniques. As a consequence, today’s G.O.P. is most clearly now the party
      of local capitalism — the small-business gentry, the family firms.... Much
      of the party elite wish to continue doing business with big business as
      before. But the party’s base regards corporate institutions — especially
      in Silicon Valley, but extending to more traditional capitalist powers —
      as cultural enemies, with too much consolidated power and too much

      The first obligation of the federal government is to provide for the
      “common defense” of the United States by securing our borders and
      protecting our homeland and our strategic interests abroad. We are not
      “the world’s police force,” but because America serves in a natural role
      of moral leadership in an increasingly dangerous world, and weakness
      invites aggression, we must remain the strongest military power on
      earth—fully prepared and capable of defeating any adversaries, tyrants or
      terrorists, under any circumstances, at any time. This requires
      maintaining sufficient investments in our air, land, sea, nuclear, and

      Republicans are prioritizing the American people over the Democrat’s
      radical climate agenda. On his first day in office, President Biden
      started the war on American energy. He has revoked the permit for the
      Keystone XL pipeline, imposed a moratorium on oil production on federal
      lands, directed agencies across the Federal government to impose punitive
      and burdensome regulations, and made us more reliant on China.
      Predictably, gas prices skyrocketed to the highest levels in American
      history. People are counting on us to improve their quality of life. H.R.
      1 delivers on that promise and will ensure America continues to lead the
      world at reducing emissions. I commend the passing of this package, which
      will boost energy production, lift regulatory burdens for the construction
      of more energy infrastructure, cut China out of our critical materials
      supply chains, and lower costs across the board. H.R. 1 is how we build a
      better and more secure future for all Americans.

      The Democratic Party is generally considered more willing to intervene in
      the economy, believing that government power is needed to regulate
      businesses that ignore social interests in the pursuit of earning a return
      for shareholders. This intervention can come in the form of regulation
      (such as limits on carbon emissions) or taxation to support social
      programs. Opponents often describe the Democratic approach to governing as
      tax and spend.

      A majority of the party's national and state candidates are at the very

      or moral grounds. However, many hold exceptions in the case of rape,
      incest or the mother's life being at risk while others may accept
      early-stage abortions (firmly opposing partial-birth abortion still). When
      Congress voted on the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act in 2003,
      congressional Republicans voted overwhelmingly to support the ban.

      Today’s Republican party, while still claiming to stand for limited

      Tennessee, Utah, Texas, Florida, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Arizona and South

      Republican states are on the way to outlawing abortions. Texas has just

      Religiously affiliated institutions broadly. A wide range of religiously

      those designed to prevent discrimination. Those claims have not been
      limited to decisions in hiring ministers and others with clearly religious

      discriminate on religious grounds even when hiring staff to fulfill
      government grants. Moreover, institutions have insisted that they be
      allowed to discriminate against LGBTQ individuals in regard to employment;
      to ignore same-sex marriages in providing employee benefits; to fire
      employees who have used abortion care, contraceptives or assisted

      Building the wall has long been one of Trump’s signature promises, but its
      impacts beyond political symbolism are unclear. Illegal border crossings
      have plunged since Trump took office in January amid a string of orders on
      immigration, including the suspension of the asylum system. Simply ending
      asylum meant tens of thousands of people who would’ve surrendered to law

      (89%) and putting more severe penalties on business for hiring people
      without legal work authorization (85%). Expanding the 700 miles of border
      wall and fencing with Mexico is also a very popular policy among

      majorities of Republicans (79%) favor using US troops to stop immigrants
      from coming into the US from Mexico. Finally, Republicans are divided over
      whether the US should make it easier for people fleeing violence in their
