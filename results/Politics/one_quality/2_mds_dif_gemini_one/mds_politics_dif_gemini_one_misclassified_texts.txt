      The Republican Party in the Trump era remained a mostly pro-business party
      in its policies but its constituencies and rhetoric have tilted more
      working class and populist, with many Romney Republicans drifting into the
      Democratic coalition....much of corporate America has swung culturally
      into liberalism’s camp. That process was well underway a decade ago, but
      it’s been accelerated by anti-Trump backlash, the more left-leaning
      commitments of big business’s younger customers and (especially) younger
      employees, and the relative ease with which the radical-sounding language
      of identity politics can be assimilated to corporate management
      techniques. As a consequence, today’s G.O.P. is most clearly now the party
      of local capitalism — the small-business gentry, the family firms.... Much
      of the party elite wish to continue doing business with big business as
      before. But the party’s base regards corporate institutions — especially
      in Silicon Valley, but extending to more traditional capitalist powers —
      as cultural enemies, with too much consolidated power and too much
      interest in pressuring, censoring, and propagandizing against socially
      conservative views and policy

      The republican conception of political liberty aims to capture this
      insight as directly as possible. It defines freedom as a sort of
      structural independence—as the condition of not being subject to the
      arbitrary or uncontrolled power of a master.

      The party opposes a government-run single-payer health care system,

      House Republicans are proposing legislation that would reduce federal
      taxes by $3.8 trillion over 10 years, with a disproportionate share of tax
      breaks going to the wealthy. The legislation would partially offset that
      revenue loss with reduced spending of $1.1 trillion over 10 years—$1.5

      Furthermore, Democrats to some degree support government-funded healthcare
      and the party thereby aims to ensure that health and social services are
      accessible for all U.S. citizens. Additionally, the Democratic Party
      generally supports women’s legal rights to free abortion as well as LGBTQ+
      people’s rights to equal treatment under the law. In opposition to
      Republicans a large part of the Democratic Party promotes a tightening of
      gun legislation and dispute the right to carry a concealed weapon (as
      opposed to open carry). Similar to the Republican Party, Democrats
      advocate for religious freedom and individuals’ right to practice their
      faith. However, at the same time, and generally more so than Republicans,
      Democrats value a separation between church and state, as is stated in the
      U.S. constitution

      As a whole, Democrats are widely concerned about climate change and
      closely follow science to remain informed about the ongoing development of
      global warming – especially as the IPCC issued in their most recent report
      that much of climate change has been aggravated by excessive human
      activity – such as mass production and increased levels of use in
      unsustainable transportation. In fact, addressing climate change is a
      pivotal topic in many agendas for those who identify with the Democratic
      party. This is because Democrats hold tight to the belief that climate
      change presents a threat to society, the economy, and the future health of
      Americans.

      Building a 100 percent clean energy economy requires clear goals to guide
      its critical decisions. The Biden administration is the first to embrace
      the goal of reaching net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by midcentury in
      order to stabilize global temperatures at 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming.*
      That means that the Biden administration’s interim target—cutting U.S.
      carbon pollution to half of peak levels by 2030—requires reducing annual
      carbon pollution nearly four times faster than the Obama administration’s
      interim target did.** Ambitious policy goals drive ambitious policy
      change.

      Climate change is ultimately viewed by Democrats as one of, if not the

      The Deocratic platform has a strong emphasis on the shift to clean energy,
      which Democrats say can also lower Americans' energy costs and create more
      jobs. Here's what the goals include: Incentivize investment in
      transmission line upgrades and new lines, which move wind and solar energy
      from where they're generated to where people live. Scale up development of
      clean energy on public lands. Invest in clean energy research and
      innovation.

      New Democrats are committed to advancing real solutions that reduce health
      care costs for families and seniors, increase choices for consumers, and
      encourage participation by the young and healthy. To stabilize health
      insurance markets and bring down the cost of healthcare for all Americans,
      New Dems believe we must create a permanent reinsurance program, reduce
      healthcare costs for low-income Americans, promote greater insurance
      coverage, create a greater number of affordable insurance options, and
      improve the marketplaces. New Democrats have sought ways to work with
      Republicans for years to fix what is not working and strengthen the ACA,
      but Republican actions continue to raise questions about their commitment
      to join these efforts.

      Immigrants contribute to the strength, vitality, and dynamism of our
      communities, our economy, and our culture; America is also a sovereign
      nation whose government has the right and the duty to control our borders
      and decide who to admit. The best way to harmonize these two traditions is
      to overhaul our system to make legal immigration work and illegal

      our students for post-secondary education, career technical education, and
      active citizenship in the 21st century. We must fully fund public
      education to correct years of insufficient allocations, increase funding
      to put California in the top states in per student spending, and equitably

      The Republicans advocate reduced taxes as a means of stimulating the
      economy and advancing individual economic freedom. They tend to oppose
      extensive government regulation of the economy, government-funded social
      programs, affirmative action, and policies aimed at strengthening the
      rights of workers. Many Republicans, though not all, favor increased
