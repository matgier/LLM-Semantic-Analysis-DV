      The first obligation of the federal government is to provide for the
      “common defense” of the United States by securing our borders and
      protecting our homeland and our strategic interests abroad. We are not
      “the world’s police force,” but because America serves in a natural role
      of moral leadership in an increasingly dangerous world, and weakness
      invites aggression, we must remain the strongest military power on
      earth—fully prepared and capable of defeating any adversaries, tyrants or
      terrorists, under any circumstances, at any time. This requires
      maintaining sufficient investments in our air, land, sea, nuclear, and
      cyber capabilities to deter foreign aggression, and properly training,
      equipping, and supporting our troops and their families, as well as our
      veterans and wounded warriors.

      Advances in personal liberty in the free world advance equality and
      inclusion; capitalism is diverse, socialism a dictatorship of conformity.
      For free-marketeers, the nostrum that diversity is an advantage is not
      only defensible but self-evident. It deserves better than to be
      surrendered as a concept and term to the identarian Left

      With rapidity and stealth, diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) ideology
      has come to replace the classical liberal values of merit, fairness and
      equality (MFE) in the academy, professional organizations, media,
      government and large technology companies. DEI bureaucracies have
      mushroomed. Many operate behind the scenes with ambiguous DEI definitions,
      goals and policies

      Liberal Democrats, by contrast, are the least supportive of these
      restrictive goals while being the most supportive of establishing a path
      to legalization for undocumented immigrants in the country.

      Half of both liberal (46%) and moderate (52%) Democrats support
      maintaining current levels of legal immigration. But liberals tend to
      endorse increasing legal immigration (44%) over decreasing it (9%), while
      moderates are slightly more likely to say it should be decreased (27%)
      than increased (20%). Majorities from both Democratic camps favor
      accepting migrants from Taiwan, Ukraine, Haiti, Central America, India,
      and Korea. Majorities of liberal Democrats also favor accepting immigrants
      from Sudan, Afghanistan, Russia, and China; moderates are at best divided
      and often opposed.

      Republicans are more likely than Democrats to support organized prayer in
      public schools and to oppose the legal recognition of equal rights for
      gays and lesbians (see gay rights movement). Regarding foreign policy, the
      Republican Party traditionally has supported a strong national defense and
      the aggressive pursuit of U.S. national security interests, even when it
      entails acting unilaterally or in opposition to the views of the
      international community.

      Republicans traditionally have believed in facing the facts as they are
      and leading in the world because our belief in freedom and justice
      deserved respect based on how we acted. This has included proper
      alliances, forging common ground and moral, principled leadership.

      Republicans are prioritizing the American people over the Democrat’s
      radical climate agenda. On his first day in office, President Biden
      started the war on American energy. He has revoked the permit for the
      Keystone XL pipeline, imposed a moratorium on oil production on federal
      lands, directed agencies across the Federal government to impose punitive
      and burdensome regulations, and made us more reliant on China.
      Predictably, gas prices skyrocketed to the highest levels in American
      history. People are counting on us to improve their quality of life. H.R.
      1 delivers on that promise and will ensure America continues to lead the
      world at reducing emissions. I commend the passing of this package, which
      will boost energy production, lift regulatory burdens for the construction
      of more energy infrastructure, cut China out of our critical materials
      supply chains, and lower costs across the board. H.R. 1 is how we build a
      better and more secure future for all Americans.

      Republicans often frame energy policy within the context of national
      security, emphasizing the need for a resilient and independent energy
      system. Hydropower’s ability to provide baseload power and enhance grid
      stability aligns with these goals. Moreover, its role in managing water
      resources, such as flood control, irrigation, and navigation, adds another
      layer of strategic importance.

      Immigrants contribute to the strength, vitality, and dynamism of our
      communities, our economy, and our culture; America is also a sovereign
      nation whose government has the right and the duty to control our borders
      and decide who to admit. The best way to harmonize these two traditions is
      to overhaul our system to make legal immigration work and illegal
      immigration stop.

      Looking ahead, the Trump administration and GOP are in a position to
      accelerate their health agenda with four key themes:, Flexibility and

      and individuals, Fiscal conservatism: Emphasize policies that reduce
      government spending in an effort to balance the budget and pass upcoming
      tax legislation, Public health reform: Revaluate the current health system

      Building the wall has long been one of Trump’s signature promises, but its
      impacts beyond political symbolism are unclear. Illegal border crossings
      have plunged since Trump took office in January amid a string of orders on
      immigration, including the suspension of the asylum system. Simply ending
      asylum meant tens of thousands of people who would’ve surrendered to law
      enforcement instead of trying to avoid capture didn’t even attempt to
      cross. Plus, the effectiveness of border walls is hotly debated, even in
      populated areas where barriers tend to be heavily reinforced. Human
      smugglers, often linked to drug cartels, have used tunnels, ladders and
      power tools to cross walls.
