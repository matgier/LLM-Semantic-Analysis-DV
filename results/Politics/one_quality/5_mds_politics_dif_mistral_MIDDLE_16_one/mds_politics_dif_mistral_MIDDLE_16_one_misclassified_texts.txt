      The Democratic Party (whose logo is a donkey) generally represents
      left-leaning, liberal and progressive ideological values, thus advocating
      for a strong government to regulate business and support for the citizens
      of the United States. Thus, one of the key values emphasized by Democrats
      is social responsibility. Overall, Democrats believe that a prominent and
      powerful government can ensure welfare and equality for all. Much like the
      Republican Party, political opinions within the Democratic Party stretch
      across a wide spectrum, as both parties are, to a large degree,
      decentralized. However, from a general point of view, Democrats tend to
      support heavy taxation of high-income households. In comparison to
      Denmark, where taxes are generally high, the Democratic taxation policy
      may not seem excessive, but on a U.S. taxation scale these tax percentages
      are in the heavy end.

      The first obligation of the federal government is to provide for the
      “common defense” of the United States by securing our borders and
      protecting our homeland and our strategic interests abroad. We are not
      “the world’s police force,” but because America serves in a natural role
      of moral leadership in an increasingly dangerous world, and weakness
      invites aggression, we must remain the strongest military power on
      earth—fully prepared and capable of defeating any adversaries, tyrants or
      terrorists, under any circumstances, at any time. This requires
      maintaining sufficient investments in our air, land, sea, nuclear, and
      cyber capabilities to deter foreign aggression, and properly training,
      equipping, and supporting our troops and their families, as well as our
      veterans and wounded warriors.

      The party opposes a government-run single-payer health care system,
      claiming it constitutes socialized medicine. It favors a personal or

      elderly and Medicaid which covers approximately 40% of the poor.[citation

      House Republicans are proposing legislation that would reduce federal
      taxes by $3.8 trillion over 10 years, with a disproportionate share of tax
      breaks going to the wealthy. The legislation would partially offset that
      revenue loss with reduced spending of $1.1 trillion over 10 years—$1.5

      Republicans are prioritizing the American people over the Democrat’s
      radical climate agenda. On his first day in office, President Biden
      started the war on American energy. He has revoked the permit for the
      Keystone XL pipeline, imposed a moratorium on oil production on federal
      lands, directed agencies across the Federal government to impose punitive
      and burdensome regulations, and made us more reliant on China.
      Predictably, gas prices skyrocketed to the highest levels in American
      history. People are counting on us to improve their quality of life. H.R.
      1 delivers on that promise and will ensure America continues to lead the
      world at reducing emissions. I commend the passing of this package, which
      will boost energy production, lift regulatory burdens for the construction
      of more energy infrastructure, cut China out of our critical materials
      supply chains, and lower costs across the board. H.R. 1 is how we build a
      better and more secure future for all Americans.

      Republican Party has historically been more supportive of policies that

      Substantively, the most important part of the Republican education
      platform might be its support for universal school choice. In about a
      dozen states, Republicans have recently created or expanded education
      savings account (ESA) programs that make public funds available to pay for
      private school or other educational expenses. Critics of these
      programs—myself included—argue that they violate our basic traditions,
      benefit the wealthy at the expense of others, and are not well supported
      by research.

      The Republican Party is often referred to as the GOP. This abbreviation
      stands for Grand Old Party. Its logo is an elephant. The Republican Party
      is known to support right-leaning ideologies of conservatism, social
      conservatism, and economic libertarianism, among other -isms. Thus,
      Republicans broadly advocate for traditional values, a low degree of
      government interference, and large support of the private sector.

      One main standpoint of the Republican Party platform is a strong focus on
      the family and individual freedom. Generally, the Republican Party
      therefore often tends to promote states’ and local rights. That means that
      they often wish for federal regulations to play a lesser role in
      policymaking. Furthermore, the GOP has a pro-business-oriented platform.
      Thus, the party advocates for businesses to exist in a free market instead
      of being impacted by tight government regulations.

      As mentioned above, Republican members and candidates’ stances towards
      particular issues may vary. Overall, however, the party is a proponent of
      religious freedom. Moreover, the GOP is generally “pro-life”, thereby
      opposing the legal right to free abortion and instead emphasizing unborn
      fetuses’ right to live. Furthermore, the party is generally against
      introducing an extensive gun control legislation, and thus Republicans
      safeguard the right to bear arms as articulated in the Second Amendment of
      the U.S. constitution. Additionally, the party values a powerful national
      defense and a strong military in order to provide increased security and
      peace.

      The republican conception of political liberty aims to capture this
      insight as directly as possible. It defines freedom as a sort of
      structural independence—as the condition of not being subject to the
      arbitrary or uncontrolled power of a master.

      For a republican constitution on Barnett’s account, the fundamental
      institutions of self-government are judicially-enforceable,
      liberty-protecting rights and institutional arrangements of executive and
      legislative power that aim to minimize rights violations and thereby
      preserve individual self-government.

      It is good that our leaders recognize the importance of creating a healthy
      regulatory environment, but there is plenty more work to be done. Three
      central pillars support a coherent deregulatory strategy: transparency,
      presidential control, and substantive deregulation where permitted by law.
      Thus far, many of the new administration’s statements and actions accord
      with them.

      Conservative economics gives policymakers the tools to understand
      capitalism and harness its power for the benefit of American workers,
      their families and communities, and the national interest. It rejects the
      market fundamentalism of libertarians who see capitalism as nothing more
      than economic “freedom” and thus expect a policy agenda of tax cuts,
      deregulation, free trade, and union-busting to unleash the economy’s
      productive forces. It likewise rejects the instinctive hostility toward
      markets from progressives, who see government as the more effective
      mechanism for solving most problems.

      By contrast, most Republicans prefer a limited role for government: 71% of
      Republicans and Republican leaners say that government is doing too many
      things better left to individuals and businesses, compared with 28% who
      say it should play a larger role. Eight-in-ten conservative Republicans
      say government is doing too many things better left to others. Views among
      moderate and liberal Republicans are more mixed: 58% say government is
      doing too many things, while 40% say it should do more to solve problems.

      The Republicans believe in Limited Government In other words, the
      Republicans belive in the rights of states, tax cuts and reduced
      government spending They are hostile to the expansion of environmental
      regulation (e.g. Trump signed an executive order rolling back Obama-era
      rules aimed at curbing climate change and had pledged to put an end to the
      'War on Coal') They do not believe in government intervention in
      healthcare (e.g. Bush vetoed the stem cell research bill and not a single
      Republican in the Senate voted in favour of Obama's healthcare reform)
      Reagan said Government is the problem

      The Republicans believe in Social Conservatism Republicans are pro-life
      (e.g. Trump said he would defund planned parenthood because they help
      provide abortion) and believe in traditional family values. Republicans
      are also unsympathetic to alternatives (e.g. Congressional Republicans
      unsuccessfully tried to bring about an amendment banning same-sex
      marriage), promote gun laws, and believe in strong law and order

12. POWINNO BYĆ weak a jest ZAKWALIFIKOWANY  jako strong
      The Republicans advocate reduced taxes as a means of stimulating the
      economy and advancing individual economic freedom. They tend to oppose
      extensive government regulation of the economy, government-funded social
      programs, affirmative action, and policies aimed at strengthening the
      rights of workers. Many Republicans, though not all, favor increased
      government regulation of the private, noneconomic lives of citizens in
      some areas, such as abortion, though most Republicans also strongly oppose
      gun-control legislation.

      Republicans are more likely than Democrats to support organized prayer in
      public schools and to oppose the legal recognition of equal rights for
      gays and lesbians (see gay rights movement). Regarding foreign policy, the
      Republican Party traditionally has supported a strong national defense and
      the aggressive pursuit of U.S. national security interests, even when it
      entails acting unilaterally or in opposition to the views of the
      international community.

      Republican states are on the way to outlawing abortions. Texas has just

      Republican Sen. Ed Setzler of Acworth said Georgia needs its own religious
      protection bill because the federal law doesn’t protect against attacks on
      religion by state and local governments. That means a local government
      might deny things like permission to distribute religious literature or a
      zoning permit for a church without giving enough deference to religious
      freedom, supporters say.

      Religiously affiliated institutions broadly. A wide range of religiously
      affiliated institutions have asserted that they have a legal and even
      constitutional right to be exempted from government requirements, even
      those designed to prevent discrimination. Those claims have not been
      limited to decisions in hiring ministers and others with clearly religious
      duties. Rather, institutions have often demanded that they be allowed to
      discriminate on religious grounds even when hiring staff to fulfill
      government grants. Moreover, institutions have insisted that they be
      allowed to discriminate against LGBTQ individuals in regard to employment;
      to ignore same-sex marriages in providing employee benefits; to fire
      employees who have used abortion care, contraceptives or assisted
      reproductive technology, or who have had sex or become pregnant outside of

      Building the wall has long been one of Trump’s signature promises, but its
      impacts beyond political symbolism are unclear. Illegal border crossings
      have plunged since Trump took office in January amid a string of orders on
      immigration, including the suspension of the asylum system. Simply ending
      asylum meant tens of thousands of people who would’ve surrendered to law
      enforcement instead of trying to avoid capture didn’t even attempt to
      cross. Plus, the effectiveness of border walls is hotly debated, even in
      populated areas where barriers tend to be heavily reinforced. Human

      Two trends make domestic production an urgent priority. The first is the

      Republican politicians are generally considered business-friendly and in

      Republicans traditionally have believed in facing the facts as they are
      and leading in the world because our belief in freedom and justice
      deserved respect based on how we acted. This has included proper
      alliances, forging common ground and moral, principled leadership.

      Republican Sen. Ed Setzler of Acworth said Georgia needs its own religious
      protection bill because the federal law doesn’t protect against attacks on
      religion by state and local governments. That means a local government
      might deny things like permission to distribute religious literature or a
      zoning permit for a church without giving enough deference to religious
      freedom, supporters say.

      Most importantly, policies must respect religious beliefs without harming
      or infringing on the rights of others. Through options like the examples

      accelerate their health agenda with four key themes:, Flexibility and

      Building the wall has long been one of Trump’s signature promises, but its
      impacts beyond political symbolism are unclear. Illegal border crossings
      have plunged since Trump took office in January amid a string of orders on
      immigration, including the suspension of the asylum system. Simply ending
      asylum meant tens of thousands of people who would’ve surrendered to law
      enforcement instead of trying to avoid capture didn’t even attempt to
      cross. Plus, the effectiveness of border walls is hotly debated, even in
      populated areas where barriers tend to be heavily reinforced. Human
      smugglers, often linked to drug cartels, have used tunnels, ladders and
      power tools to cross walls.

      House Republicans are proposing legislation that would reduce federal
      taxes by $3.8 trillion over 10 years, with a disproportionate share of tax
      breaks going to the wealthy. The legislation would partially offset that

      Republicans are prioritizing the American people over the Democrat’s
      radical climate agenda. On his first day in office, President Biden
      started the war on American energy. He has revoked the permit for the
      Keystone XL pipeline, imposed a moratorium on oil production on federal
      lands, directed agencies across the Federal government to impose punitive
      and burdensome regulations, and made us more reliant on China.
      Predictably, gas prices skyrocketed to the highest levels in American
      history. People are counting on us to improve their quality of life. H.R.
      1 delivers on that promise and will ensure America continues to lead the
      world at reducing emissions. I commend the passing of this package, which
      will boost energy production, lift regulatory burdens for the construction
      of more energy infrastructure, cut China out of our critical materials
      supply chains, and lower costs across the board. H.R. 1 is how we build a
      better and more secure future for all Americans.

      Two trends make domestic production an urgent priority. The first is the
      high cost of energy, which is burdening all of us. In the last four years,
      gasoline, electricity, and natural gas prices have risen by nearly a
      third. Removing restrictions on our energy companies can bring down these
      ballooning costs

      Republican politicians are generally considered business-friendly and in
      favor of limited government regulation of the economy. This means favoring
      policies that put business interests ahead of environmental concerns,
      labor union interests, healthcare benefits, and retirement benefits. Given
      this more pro-business bias, Republicans tend to receive more support from
      business owners and investment capitalists.

      The Democratic Party is generally considered more willing to intervene in
      the economy, believing that government power is needed to regulate
      businesses that ignore social interests in the pursuit of earning a return
      for shareholders. This intervention can come in the form of regulation
      (such as limits on carbon emissions) or taxation to support social
      programs. Opponents often describe the Democratic approach to governing as
      tax and spend.

      Substantively, the most important part of the Republican education
      platform might be its support for universal school choice. In about a
      dozen states, Republicans have recently created or expanded education
      savings account (ESA) programs that make public funds available to pay for
      private school or other educational expenses. Critics of these
      programs—myself included—argue that they violate our basic traditions,
      benefit the wealthy at the expense of others, and are not well supported

      Republicans broadly favor punitive approaches to immigration policy, such
      as increasing deportations of people who are in the country illegally
      (89%) and putting more severe penalties on business for hiring people
      without legal work authorization (85%). Expanding the 700 miles of border
      wall and fencing with Mexico is also a very popular policy among
      Republicans (87% support), and as the 2023 Chicago Council Survey found,
      majorities of Republicans (79%) favor using US troops to stop immigrants
      from coming into the US from Mexico. Finally, Republicans are divided over
      whether the US should make it easier for people fleeing violence in their
      home countries to legally immigrate to the United States, with similar
      proportions supporting (49%) and opposing (50%) such a policy.
