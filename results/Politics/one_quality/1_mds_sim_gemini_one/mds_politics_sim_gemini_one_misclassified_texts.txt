      By contrast, most Republicans prefer a limited role for government: 71% of
      Republicans and Republican leaners say that government is doing too many
      things better left to individuals and businesses, compared with 28% who
      say it should play a larger role. Eight-in-ten conservative Republicans
      say government is doing too many things better left to others. Views among
      moderate and liberal Republicans are more mixed: 58% say government is
      doing too many things, while 40% say it should do more to solve problems.

      Two trends make domestic production an urgent priority. The first is the
      high cost of energy, which is burdening all of us. In the last four years,
      gasoline, electricity, and natural gas prices have risen by nearly a
      third. Removing restrictions on our energy companies can bring down these
      ballooning costs

      New Democrats are committed to advancing real solutions that reduce health
      care costs for families and seniors, increase choices for consumers, and
      encourage participation by the young and healthy. To stabilize health
      insurance markets and bring down the cost of healthcare for all Americans,
      New Dems believe we must create a permanent reinsurance program, reduce
      healthcare costs for low-income Americans, promote greater insurance
      coverage, create a greater number of affordable insurance options, and
      improve the marketplaces. New Democrats have sought ways to work with
      Republicans for years to fix what is not working and strengthen the ACA,
      but Republican actions continue to raise questions about their commitment
      to join these efforts.

      The republican conception of political liberty aims to capture this
      insight as directly as possible. It defines freedom as a sort of
      structural independence—as the condition of not being subject to the
      arbitrary or uncontrolled power of a master.

      For a republican constitution on Barnett’s account, the fundamental
      institutions of self-government are judicially-enforceable,
      liberty-protecting rights and institutional arrangements of executive and
      legislative power that aim to minimize rights violations and thereby
      preserve individual self-government.

      Conservative economics gives policymakers the tools to understand
      capitalism and harness its power for the benefit of American workers,
      their families and communities, and the national interest. It rejects the
      market fundamentalism of libertarians who see capitalism as nothing more
      than economic “freedom” and thus expect a policy agenda of tax cuts,
      deregulation, free trade, and union-busting to unleash the economy’s
      productive forces. It likewise rejects the instinctive hostility toward
      markets from progressives, who see government as the more effective
      mechanism for solving most problems.

      The Republicans believe in Social Conservatism Republicans are pro-life
      (e.g. Trump said he would defund planned parenthood because they help
      provide abortion) and believe in traditional family values. Republicans
      are also unsympathetic to alternatives (e.g. Congressional Republicans
      unsuccessfully tried to bring about an amendment banning same-sex
      marriage), promote gun laws, and believe in strong law and order

      Republicans are more likely than Democrats to support organized prayer in
      public schools and to oppose the legal recognition of equal rights for
      gays and lesbians (see gay rights movement). Regarding foreign policy, the
      Republican Party traditionally has supported a strong national defense and
      the aggressive pursuit of U.S. national security interests, even when it
      entails acting unilaterally or in opposition to the views of the
      international community.

      The first obligation of the federal government is to provide for the
      “common defense” of the United States by securing our borders and
      protecting our homeland and our strategic interests abroad. We are not
      “the world’s police force,” but because America serves in a natural role
      of moral leadership in an increasingly dangerous world, and weakness
      invites aggression, we must remain the strongest military power on
      earth—fully prepared and capable of defeating any adversaries, tyrants or
      terrorists, under any circumstances, at any time. This requires
      maintaining sufficient investments in our air, land, sea, nuclear, and
      cyber capabilities to deter foreign aggression, and properly training,
      equipping, and supporting our troops and their families, as well as our
      veterans and wounded warriors.

      Religiously affiliated institutions broadly. A wide range of religiously
      affiliated institutions have asserted that they have a legal and even
      constitutional right to be exempted from government requirements, even
      those designed to prevent discrimination. Those claims have not been
      limited to decisions in hiring ministers and others with clearly religious
      duties. Rather, institutions have often demanded that they be allowed to
      discriminate on religious grounds even when hiring staff to fulfill
      government grants. Moreover, institutions have insisted that they be
      allowed to discriminate against LGBTQ individuals in regard to employment;
      to ignore same-sex marriages in providing employee benefits; to fire
      employees who have used abortion care, contraceptives or assisted
      reproductive technology, or who have had sex or become pregnant outside of
      marriage; or even to ignore federal law preventing discrimination on the
      basis of disability.

      Most importantly, policies must respect religious beliefs without harming
      or infringing on the rights of others. Through options like the examples
      below, policymakers can create the framework for a balanced, inclusive
      vision of religious liberty throughout the United States.

      This strategy moves public thinking toward support for progressive
      immigration reform by explaining why this issue is economically beneficial
      to everyone, how it works, and what we can do about it as a country. The
      full “shared prosperity” narrative first uses a moral argument to help
      people see immigrants as regular, hardworking people, and explain why
      reform is so important. Specifically, the morality frame establishes that
      we have a moral obligation to respect human dignity. Second, the narrative
      explains how immigration contributes to our shared prosperity—whether by
      expanding the tax base or attracting talent to important industries—and
      helps people see the need for immigration reform. Finally, the narrative
      offers specific solutions to fix the system’s current deficits, nurtures
      belief in the possibility of change, and drives collective action to
      improve outcomes.

      Half of both liberal (46%) and moderate (52%) Democrats support
      maintaining current levels of legal immigration. But liberals tend to
      endorse increasing legal immigration (44%) over decreasing it (9%), while
      moderates are slightly more likely to say it should be decreased (27%)
      than increased (20%). Majorities from both Democratic camps favor
      accepting migrants from Taiwan, Ukraine, Haiti, Central America, India,
      and Korea. Majorities of liberal Democrats also favor accepting immigrants
      from Sudan, Afghanistan, Russia, and China; moderates are at best divided

      House Republicans are proposing legislation that would reduce federal
      taxes by $3.8 trillion over 10 years, with a disproportionate share of tax
      breaks going to the wealthy. The legislation would partially offset that
      revenue loss with reduced spending of $1.1 trillion over 10 years—$1.5
      trillion in spending cuts that include deep and harmful cuts to nutrition
      assistance and health care for low-income households,
