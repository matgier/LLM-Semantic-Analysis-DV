      The first obligation of the federal government is to provide for the
      “common defense” of the United States by securing our borders and
      protecting our homeland and our strategic interests abroad. We are not
      “the world’s police force,” but because America serves in a natural role
      of moral leadership in an increasingly dangerous world, and weakness
      invites aggression, we must remain the strongest military power on
      earth—fully prepared and capable of defeating any adversaries, tyrants or
      terrorists, under any circumstances, at any time. This requires
      maintaining sufficient investments in our air, land, sea, nuclear, and
      cyber capabilities to deter foreign aggression, and properly training,
      equipping, and supporting our troops and their families, as well as our
      veterans and wounded warriors.

      Republicans are prioritizing the American people over the Democrat’s
      radical climate agenda. On his first day in office, President Biden
      started the war on American energy. He has revoked the permit for the
      Keystone XL pipeline, imposed a moratorium on oil production on federal
      lands, directed agencies across the Federal government to impose punitive
      and burdensome regulations, and made us more reliant on China.
      Predictably, gas prices skyrocketed to the highest levels in American
      history. People are counting on us to improve their quality of life. H.R.

      world at reducing emissions. I commend the passing of this package, which
      will boost energy production, lift regulatory burdens for the construction
      of more energy infrastructure, cut China out of our critical materials
      supply chains, and lower costs across the board. H.R. 1 is how we build a

      Two trends make domestic production an urgent priority. The first is the
      high cost of energy, which is burdening all of us. In the last four years,
      gasoline, electricity, and natural gas prices have risen by nearly a
      third. Removing restrictions on our energy companies can bring down these

      The Democratic Party (whose logo is a donkey) generally represents
      left-leaning, liberal and progressive ideological values, thus advocating
      for a strong government to regulate business and support for the citizens
      of the United States. Thus, one of the key values emphasized by Democrats
      is social responsibility. Overall, Democrats believe that a prominent and
      powerful government can ensure welfare and equality for all. Much like the
      Republican Party, political opinions within the Democratic Party stretch
      across a wide spectrum, as both parties are, to a large degree,
      decentralized. However, from a general point of view, Democrats tend to
      support heavy taxation of high-income households. In comparison to
      Denmark, where taxes are generally high, the Democratic taxation policy
      may not seem excessive, but on a U.S. taxation scale these tax percentages
      are in the heavy end.

      We believe that no matter where we come from or what our color, most of us
      want the same things. We want to earn enough to thrive, not just survive,
      and leave a better future for our kids. We want healthy food and clean
      water, safe neighborhoods and a safe world. We want to be free.

      Democrats, which is the political party developed during Andrew Jackson’s
      presidency, is known for being accepting and open-minded while placing a
      strong emphasis on providing equal opportunities for all Americans despite
      their race, sexuality, religion, or national origin. Democrats are often
      looking to protect immigrants in the U.S. and will be supportive of
      pro-choice, and as a result – Democrats often lead in creating
      government-funded social programs that will seek to help these minorities.
      In short, Democrats look to create equality and implement socialist values
      where they see fit in order to achieve their key value of equal rights and
      opportunities for all

      The Deocratic platform has a strong emphasis on the shift to clean energy,
      which Democrats say can also lower Americans' energy costs and create more
      jobs. Here's what the goals include: Incentivize investment in
      transmission line upgrades and new lines, which move wind and solar energy
      from where they're generated to where people live. Scale up development of
      clean energy on public lands. Invest in clean energy research and

      Advances in personal liberty in the free world advance equality and

      New Democrats are committed to advancing real solutions that reduce health
      care costs for families and seniors, increase choices for consumers, and
      encourage participation by the young and healthy. To stabilize health
      insurance markets and bring down the cost of healthcare for all Americans,
      New Dems believe we must create a permanent reinsurance program, reduce
      healthcare costs for low-income Americans, promote greater insurance
      coverage, create a greater number of affordable insurance options, and
      improve the marketplaces. New Democrats have sought ways to work with
      Republicans for years to fix what is not working and strengthen the ACA,
      but Republican actions continue to raise questions about their commitment

      DFLA is committed to expanding access to health care. Our members take a

      Half of both liberal (46%) and moderate (52%) Democrats support

      moderates are slightly more likely to say it should be decreased (27%)
      than increased (20%). Majorities from both Democratic camps favor
      accepting migrants from Taiwan, Ukraine, Haiti, Central America, India,
      and Korea. Majorities of liberal Democrats also favor accepting immigrants

      It is good that our leaders recognize the importance of creating a healthy
      regulatory environment, but there is plenty more work to be done. Three

      Deregulation is the reduction or elimination of government oversight of an
      industry. Proponents of deregulation argue that deregulation creates more
      competition and spurs economic growth. Opponents assert that deregulation
      risks grave harm to consumers, workers, and the environment. The struggle
      between proponents of regulation and those of government nonintervention
      has shifted market conditions. Some of the sectors that have been
      deregulated in the United States include trucking, railroads, and
      airlines. The financial services industry has been regulated, deregulated,
      and re-regulated over the years as events warranted.
