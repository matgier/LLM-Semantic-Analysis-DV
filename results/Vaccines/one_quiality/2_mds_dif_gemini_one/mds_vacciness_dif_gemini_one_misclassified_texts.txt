      But once the novel coronavirus was discovered and sequenced in Wuhan,
      China, everything changed, nearly overnight. Within days, mRNA coronavirus
      vaccines were being widely acknowledged as one of our best bets against
      the virus. Scientists started using the technology to develop shots — on a
      breathtakingly rapid timeline. Suddenly, it seemed, everyone wanted to
      know who was responsible for this promising technique. If Malone is right
      about one thing pertaining to the mRNA vaccines, Geall said, it's that it
      is still important to keep researching these products and answering any
      yet unanswered questions about them, in addition to improving how and when
      they're used. "Would I have preferred that there had been 15 years of
      research and safety generation through clinical trials? Absolutely," Geall
      said. "But that wasn't an option during the pandemic." So he, and all the
      other scientists interviewed for this article, got vaccinated with the
      mRNA vaccines that they, Malone, and many others helped create over a
      30-year period.

      Vaccine trials often take years because not only do they need to recruit a
      lot of participants to be able to evaluate safety and efficacy, they then
      need to wait for natural infections to take place. The COVID-19 vaccine
      trials have moved along faster thanks to extra financial support from the
      government and other funding sources, and the high prevalence of the virus
      in the community, said Boslett. “They didn’t skip any steps.” More than
      40,000 people were enrolled in the Pfizer vaccine trials, and more than
      30,000 in the Moderna vaccine trials. “That’s a lot of people, but if the
      virus were rare, that still wouldn’t be enough people,” said Boslett. “But
      because the virus is running so rampant throughout the U.S. and other
      places in the world, this was actually a good number of people to show a
      difference between the vaccinated and unvaccinated groups.” The mRNA
      technology, which has undergone years of study for other potential
      vaccines, was another time-saver. Compared to vaccines that use live
      viruses, mRNA vaccines are relatively easy to manufacture. “Virus is
      actually hard to grow,” said Boslett. “The fact that this wasn’t a live
      vaccine allowed the manufacturing to be a little bit simpler.”

      Can the dramatic increase in autism be ascribed to change in diagnostic
      practice? Data from the recent California report from the Office of
      Developmental Services belie this contention. The Figure 1 juxtaposes the
      data from California with those from north-west London. Identical temporal
      trends are shown, with the rise in autism from a steady baseline value,
      coinciding with the introduction of MMR vaccine as the single strategy in
      both countries that use the same diagnostic criteria for autism.

      For some, the concern is the vaccine itself — and particularly the side
      effects that can come with it. These concerns can be about something the
      vaccine really causes, like a day or two of aches, fever, and fatigue or,
      in extremely rare cases, potentially blood clots. But they can also be
      about things that aren’t real or proven, like other long-term health risks
      or unproven claims about, for example, infertility.

      The first reason relates to the view that healthcare is a matter of
      personal risk, choice, and responsibility. Many parents, across the
      spectrum of vaccination attitudes, hold this worldview. Yet some parents
      see this worldview as being in conflict with vaccination promotion
      messages. These messages emphasise population-level risk and community
      health. This perceived tension may lead some parents to be hesitant about
      vaccination for their children.

      The second reason relates to the impact of social exclusion. Exclusion can
      take many different forms: economic, political, and cultural. All these
      forms can lay the foundation for distrust, alienation, resentment, and
      demotivation. Parents who are socially excluded may be hesitant about
      vaccination because they distrust vaccines and those delivering them. Or
      it may be a form of resistance or a mechanism to bring about change. It
      may be that vaccination takes time and comes with opportunity costs for
      these parents.

      Opponents say that children’s immune systems can deal with most infections
      naturally, and that injecting questionable vaccine ingredients into a

      They contend that numerous studies prove that vaccines may trigger

      Vaccines contain harmful ingredients. Aluminum is used in some vaccines
      and excess aluminum in human bodies can cause neurological harm.
      Formaldehyde, also found in some vaccines, is a carcinogen, and, according
      to VaxTruth.org, exposure can cause side effects such as cardiac
      impairment, central nervous system depression, “changes in higher
      cognitive functions,” coma, convulsions, and death. Glutaraldehyde, a
      compound used to disinfect medical and dental equipment, is used in some
      DTaP vaccinations and exposure can cause asthma and other respiratory
      issues. Some flu vaccines contain cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTMB), a
      compound used as an antiseptic, which can be a skin, eye, and respiratory
      irritant.

      Most diseases that vaccines target are relatively harmless in many cases,
      thus making vaccines unnecessary. The chickenpox is often just a rash with
      blisters and can be treated with acetaminophen, cool compresses, and
      calamine lotion. The measles is normally a rash accompanied by a fever and
      runny nose and can be treated with rest and fluids. Rubella is often just
      a virus with a rash and low fever and can be treated with acetaminophen.
      Rotavirus can normally be treated with hydration and probiotics.

      Vaccinated individuals have accounted for 73 percent of all covid-19 cases
      in England over the past month and are the obvious driving factor for
      viral transmission. The vaccinated are also the ones crowding the
      hospitals. There were 2,341 unvaccinated hospitalizations last month (a
      number that is falling rapidly). However, there were 6,889
      hospitalizations for the vaccinated (a number that is rapidly increasing).
      Most of these hospitalizations are occurring in triply vaccinated
      individuals (4,936). In all, 75 percent of all Covid-19 hospitalizations
      are observed in the vaccinated. When it comes to fatalities, the
      unvaccinated cohort is improving. The unvaccinated accounted for 559
      deaths in the last reporting period and the vaccinated accounted for 4,302
      deaths, with the majority of fatalities occurring in the triply vaccinated
      (3,120). The vaccinated population now accounts for 90 percent of the
      deaths overall. The triply vaccinated account for 4 of every 5 of these
      fatalities! To put these figures in perspective, take a look at the Week
      51 Vaccine Surveillance Report for 2021. From November 22 to December 19,
      2021, there were 889 unvaccinated deaths and 2,913 vaccinated deaths. This
      shows that the fatality rate for the unvaccinated population is going
      down, while the fatality rate for the vaccinated population is getting
      severely worse. So, why hasn’t a strict moratorium been placed on this
      destructive vaccine?

      It is true that the production of all three of the leading candidates –
      the newly-approved Pfizer/BioNTech jab, Moderna and the Oxford/AstraZeneca
      vaccine – have achieved in less than ten months what usually takes a
      decade. But, despite the speed, none of these vaccine trials have actually
      skipped any steps. Instead, some of the stages overlapped. For example,
      phase three of the trial – when tens of thousands of trial participants
      were given the jab – commenced when phase two – which saw hundreds
      receiving the vaccine – was still ongoing. At a Downing Street press
      conference on Wednesday, Dr June Raine – the head of the UK’s regulatory
      agency which has given the Pfizer treatment the thumbs up – said no
      corners have been cut. “If you’re climbing a mountain, you prepare and
      prepare. We started that in June. By the time the interim results became
      available on 10 November we were at base camp,” she said. “And then when
      we got the final analysis we were ready for that last sprint that takes us
      to today.” Vaccine trials are usually held up by long periods of inertia –
      waiting for funding, resources and permissions to come through. But,
      because of the huge global stake in ending the pandemic, there was no
      waiting game. A huge amount of funding and support were poured into
      vaccine efforts across the world – and that’s brought us to where we are
      today. As for side effects, they usually show up in trials quickly after
      vaccination – while longer-term effects are very rare. So you don’t have
      anything to worry about on that front, either.

      Thalidomide is a drug that was marketed as a treatment for morning
      sickness in pregnant women in the late 1950s and early 60s and later
      caused birth defects. This has understandably prompted distrust in
      government guidance on public health issues. However, Thalidomide is not
      comparable to a vaccine. Thalidomide went directly into the bloodstream,
      whereas the Covid-19 vaccine gives antibodies which help fight off the
      virus. Thalidomide was not properly tested and never went through the
      monitoring system as the coronavirus vaccine has done. Dr Ruth Blue, a
      consultant for the Thalidomide Society, said it was “a bit insulting that
      suddenly Thalidomide gets remembered after all these years when it suits
      anti-vaxxers to have something to compare to — but it isn’t a comparison.
      “The outcome of Thalidomide completely changed the way drugs are tested
      and are passed.” She added: “Vaccinations are a really fairly safe form of
      medicine. They have been around for a very long time. There have been very
      few problems with vaccinations over the years and it’s not really
      comparable. They are a tried and tested science and they have saved
      absolutely millions of lives. “Thalidomide did totally the opposite. It
      wasn’t tested, it wasn’t tried out and it destroyed millions of lives.”

      Parental refusal of vaccines is a growing a concern for the increased
      occurrence of vaccine preventable diseases in children. A number of
      studies have looked into the reasons that parents refuse, delay, or are
      hesitant to vaccinate their child(ren). These reasons vary widely between
      parents, but they can be encompassed in 4 overarching categories. The 4
      categories are religious reasons, personal beliefs or philosophical
      reasons, safety concerns, and a desire for more information from
      healthcare providers. Parental concerns about vaccines in each category
      lead to a wide spectrum of decisions varying from parents completely
      refusing all vaccinations to only delaying vaccinations so that they are
      more spread out. A large subset of parents admits to having concerns and
      questions about childhood vaccinations. For this reason, it can be helpful
      for pharmacists and other healthcare providers to understand the cited
      reasons for hesitancy so they are better prepared to educate their
      patients' families. Education is a key player in equipping parents with
      the necessary information so that they can make responsible immunization
      decisions for their children.

      Proponents of vaccine mandates typically claim that everyone who can be
      vaccinated has a moral or ethical obligation to do so for the sake of
      those who cannot be vaccinated, or in the interest of public health. I
      evaluate several previously undertheorised premises implicit to the
      ‘obligation to vaccinate’ type of arguments and show that the general
      conclusion is false: there is neither a moral obligation to vaccinate nor
      a sound ethical basis to mandate vaccination under any circumstances, even
      for hypothetical vaccines that are medically risk-free. Agent autonomy
      with respect to self-constitution has absolute normative priority over
      reduction or elimination of the associated risks to life. In practical
      terms, mandatory vaccination amounts to discrimination against healthy,
      innate biological characteristics, which goes against the established
      ethical norms and is also defeasible a priori.

      Some people don’t get flu vaccines for themselves or for their children.
      There are several reasons for this, including: The flu vaccine doesn’t

      After 2 years of Covid ravaging America, less than 1 in 7 people have
      statistically been known to contract the virus. That number is even less
      when you consider the number of reinfections. Why are the number of
      reinfections “rare” when desiring high numbers of cases, but “likely” when
      referring to the un-vaccinated? Why would 100% of the population have to
      take an experimental medical treatment, when the vast majority will
      probably never even be infected by the virus, and if they were, most would
      be very unlikely to die from it? It has been estimated that people over 70
      are at least 10,000 times more likely to die from Covid-19 as those under

      But what about the second and third waves of “cases”, including from Delta
      and other variants, around the world? It is important to understand that a
      COVID-19 “case”, as currently defined, does not correspond to being ill.
      To an unprecedented extent in medical history, rather than referring to
      actual disease, the term “case” has become conflated with nothing more
      than a positive Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test result. While PCR
      tests are useful in laboratory research and as diagnostic tools when
      carefully performed, they are not reliable or appropriate when used in
      isolation, nor set at extremely high sensitivities, nor in poorly trained
      hands, as has been the case overwhelmingly for COVID-19. It has long been
      known that reliance on PCR tests alone to define medical “cases” and
      causes of death results in “overdiagnosis, overtreatment, and increased
      health care costs” [21]. If PCR alone were used to diagnose an infection
      with the diarrhoeal pathogen Clostridium difficile (CD), for instance, an
      epidemic of CD would immediately appear. We would find, based on PCR
      results, that 50% of people in long term care, and 15% of those
      hospitalised for any reason, are CD “cases” [22]. Should they die of any
      cause following a positive PCR test for CD, they would be recorded as
      “dying with” CD. That figure could conceivably approach 100% if PCR tests
      were performed at the high sensitivities, or cycle thresholds, routinely
      employed when testing for COVID-19, in which the sensitivity of the test
      has been dialled up to meaningless extremes [23]. Horeover, even if we
      accepted PCR alone as a diagnostically appropriate tool—and therefore the
      high number of “cases” that it generates—we would still necessarily infer
      a very low infection fatality rate for COVID-19. This supports rather than
      contradicts the reality that SARS-CoV-2 poses no significant threat to the
      immunocompetent. In short, thanks to population immunity, for the vast
      majority of us, a “case” does not equate to severe disease.

      Pharmaceutical industry expert Professor Frank Lichtenberg estimates that

      “The first time your body sees the spike protein, it activates some immune
      system cells to begin to recognize and develop antibodies against that
      protein,” said Boslett. The response may be similar whether that first
      encounter is from infection with the virus or from the first dose of the
      vaccine. Studies of the mRNA vaccines suggest that one dose may offer
      between 50 to 80 percent protection against symptomatic COVID-19, though
      more data is needed, said Boslett. “We know you get some amount of
      protection after one dose of the vaccine or after infection with the
      virus, but we don’t know in either case how long that protection lasts,”
      she said. Some cases of reinfection have been reported after three to six
      months, so the protection from one dose of the vaccine also may wane in
      that timeframe. “However, when you get the second dose of the vaccine,
      you’re further training your immune system,” said Boslett. “You’re
      strengthening that response from the antibody-producing B cells and you’re
      also activating T memory cells that stick around for much longer.” Getting
      both doses of the vaccine means your body is shown this spike protein
      multiple times in a short duration. “So that immune response might be
      bigger, better and longer lasting than just getting the infection one
      time,” she said. Because the booster effect is so important, Boslett adds
      that this is why people who have had COVID-19 are still recommended to get
      the vaccine.

      Some vaccines, such as the measles or oral polio vaccines, contain a
      weakened form of the live virus, and in very rare cases these can cause
      disease. “But this isn’t one of those,” said Boslett. “The mRNA vaccines
      just contain a message that encodes the spike protein. It is not a live
      virus, so there’s no chance that the vaccine can give you COVID.” Some
      people may feel symptoms such as fever or muscle aches after the vaccines,
      but those are due to your body’s immune response, not an infection. “That
      is actually not a bad thing because that means that your body is producing
      an inflammatory response to the vaccine, which is what we want.”

      Recent data suggest COVID-19 vaccines become less effective at preventing
      infection or severe illness over time, especially for people ages 65 years
      and older. This is why booster shots are recommended for people ages 12
      years and older who have completed their primary vaccination series.
      However, even as the vaccine’s ability to prevent infection decreases with

      So vaccines are NOT safe by design. Safety by testing ALONE, is an
      unacceptable strategy for such a safety critical product. And it is too
      late when the safety problems are detected in the general public, as is
      the case now and as clearly demonstrated by the Pandemrix induced
      narcolepsy disaster. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) lamented in 2012 that
      "for the majority of cases (135 vaccine-adverse event pairs), the evidence
      was inadequate to accept or reject a causal relationship." The evidence
      for vaccine safety claims simply does NOT exist. Many epidemiological
      vaccine safety studies make the basic mistake of declaring "lack of
      association" because the confidence interval of the odds ratio does not
      span the null value. These conclusions are simply wrong. Mechanistic

      Thalidomide is a drug that was marketed as a treatment for morning
      sickness in pregnant women in the late 1950s and early 60s and later
      caused birth defects. This has understandably prompted distrust in
      government guidance on public health issues. However, Thalidomide is not
      comparable to a vaccine. Thalidomide went directly into the bloodstream,
      whereas the Covid-19 vaccine gives antibodies which help fight off the
      virus. Thalidomide was not properly tested and never went through the
      monitoring system as the coronavirus vaccine has done. Dr Ruth Blue, a
      consultant for the Thalidomide Society, said it was “a bit insulting that
      suddenly Thalidomide gets remembered after all these years when it suits
      anti-vaxxers to have something to compare to — but it isn’t a comparison.
      “The outcome of Thalidomide completely changed the way drugs are tested
      and are passed.” She added: “Vaccinations are a really fairly safe form of
      medicine. They have been around for a very long time. There have been very
      few problems with vaccinations over the years and it’s not really
      comparable. They are a tried and tested science and they have saved
      absolutely millions of lives. “Thalidomide did totally the opposite. It
      wasn’t tested, it wasn’t tried out and it destroyed millions of lives.”

      A new study has also found a reduction in transmission rates even after
      the first dose. Those who test positive for Covid-19 showed that twelve or
      more days after taking the first dose have a viral load that is four times
      lower than those who have not been vaccinated. Those receiving the vaccine
      became far less of a COVID transmission risk even before receiving their
      second dose.

      1. You may no longer be protected. You may have received a vaccine as a
      child. But some vaccines require a booster if you want to remain
      protected. Protection may not be life-long for diseases like pertussis
      (whooping cough) or tetanus, which is usually given with the diphtheria
      toxoid. The CDC recommends a booster for the latter every 10 years after
      an initial childhood series.

      One vaccine ingredient that has been studied specifically is thimerosal.
      Thimerosal is a mercury-based preservative used to prevent germs (like
      bacteria and fungi) from contaminating multidose vials of vaccines.
      Research shows that thimerosal does not cause ASD. In fact, a 2004
      scientific review by the IOM concluded that "the evidence favors rejection
      of a causal relationship between thimerosal–containing vaccines and
      autism."

      Severe side effects: we would also expect to see 1 to 2 people experience
      a severe complication like TTS. The risks of TTS are higher for younger
      people, especially those under 60 years. Anyone who develops severe
      headaches and tiredness up to 30 days after the first dose should seek
      medical help immediately. It’s important to know that even if someone
      becomes ill with TTS, doctors now have a better understanding of the
      condition. It’s much easier to diagnose and get the right treatment, so
      the chances of recovery are higher than they were before.

      Beyond concerns about side effects, many of the hesitant just don’t have
      much trust in the vaccines. They may believe that the process for the
      vaccines was too fast — it was, after all, a record time from conception
      to mass production. They may note the vaccines aren’t even technically
      approved by the Food and Drug Administration since the agency has only
      authorized them for emergency use.

      For some, the concern is the vaccine itself — and particularly the side
      effects that can come with it. These concerns can be about something the
      vaccine really causes, like a day or two of aches, fever, and fatigue or,
      in extremely rare cases, potentially blood clots. But they can also be
      about things that aren’t real or proven, like other long-term health risks
      or unproven claims about, for example, infertility.

      Based on the extensive review presented, GACVS concluded that no evidence
      exists of a causal association between MMR vaccine and autism or autistic
      disorders. The Committee believes the matter is likely to be clarified by
      a better understanding of the causes of autism. GACVS also concluded that
      there is no evidence to support the routine use of monovalent measles,
      mumps and rubella vaccines over the combined vaccine, a strategy which
      would put children at increased risk of incomplete immunization. Thus,
      GACVS recommends that there should be no change in current vaccination
      practices with MMR.

      The ingredients in vaccines are safe in the amounts used. Ingredients,
      such as thimerosal, formaldehyde, and aluminum, can be harmful in large
      doses but they are not used in harmful quantities in vaccines. Children
      are exposed to more aluminum in breast milk and infant formula than they
      are exposed to in vaccines. Paul Offit, MD, notes that children are
      exposed to more bacteria, viruses, toxins, and other harmful substances in
      one day of normal activity than are in vaccines. With the exception of
      inactivated flu vaccines, thimerosal (a mercury compound) has been removed
      or reduced to trace amounts in vaccines for children under 6 years old.
      The FDA requires up to 10 or more years of testing for all vaccines before
      they are licensed, and then they are monitored by the CDC and the FDA to
      make sure the vaccines and the ingredients used in the vaccines are safe.

      Any vaccine can cause side effects. Usually, these side effects are minor
      — a low-grade fever, fussiness and soreness at the injection site. Some
      vaccines cause a temporary headache, fatigue or loss of appetite. Rarely,
      a child might experience a severe allergic reaction or a neurological side
      effect, such as a seizure. Although these rare side effects are a concern,
      the risk of a vaccine causing serious harm or death is extremely small.
      The benefits of getting a vaccine are much greater than the possible side
      effects for almost all children.

      For now, those who believe in the overwhelmingly debunked theories of
      vaccines remain in the minority. According to the CDC, in the United
      States, 95% of children in kindergarten have had vaccines for preventable
      diseases, including two doses of the MMR vaccine. But that figure is not
      uniform across the country. And top lawmakers recently sent a letter to
      Congress expressing their unqualified support for vaccines. Some state
      legislatures are trying to stamp out resistance to vaccines. In
      California, for instance, the state significantly limited the grounds on
      which a parent could opt out of vaccinating her children. California
      pediatrician, Branco, instituted a policy in 2012 that stated he will no
      longer see children who haven’t received the MMR vaccine by the age of
      two. He told the Examiner he understands it’s hard for parents to evaluate
      the evidence when they are hearing so many different anecdotes, but that
      he wants to keep his other vaccinated patients healthy. “I think people
      will fixate on the stories,” he said. “What is hard for parents to do is
      take a step back from the personal story and say what’s the real risk.”

      Parental refusal of vaccines is a growing a concern for the increased
      occurrence of vaccine preventable diseases in children. A number of
      studies have looked into the reasons that parents refuse, delay, or are
      hesitant to vaccinate their child(ren). These reasons vary widely between
      parents, but they can be encompassed in 4 overarching categories. The 4
      categories are religious reasons, personal beliefs or philosophical
      reasons, safety concerns, and a desire for more information from
      healthcare providers. Parental concerns about vaccines in each category
      lead to a wide spectrum of decisions varying from parents completely
      refusing all vaccinations to only delaying vaccinations so that they are
      more spread out. A large subset of parents admits to having concerns and
      questions about childhood vaccinations. For this reason, it can be helpful
      for pharmacists and other healthcare providers to understand the cited
      reasons for hesitancy so they are better prepared to educate their
      patients' families. Education is a key player in equipping parents with
      the necessary information so that they can make responsible immunization
      decisions for their children.

      Covid-19 is a coronavirus (like a cold). ALL coronaviruses can be
      prevented and treated through more natural methods. All viruses mutate.
      This means that to be “protected”, you must continually accept new
      experimental vaccines or boosters. Most people who have taken the
      vaccines, have done so out of fear or were bullied by society, corporate
      America, or the government. Most people who have refused the vaccines,
      have done so because of a lack of evidence for safety or effectiveness.
      (Or, because they understand a great many things on this list.) Young
      healthy people have a 99.9% chance of surviving Covid-19, if they even
      contract the virus. Why is it that those promoting the vaccines for
      children, demand that school children wear masks which are scientifically
      proven to be useless against a virus, but proven to inhibit the immune

      After 2 years of Covid ravaging America, less than 1 in 7 people have
      statistically been known to contract the virus. That number is even less
      when you consider the number of reinfections. Why are the number of
      reinfections “rare” when desiring high numbers of cases, but “likely” when
      referring to the un-vaccinated? Why would 100% of the population have to
      take an experimental medical treatment, when the vast majority will
      probably never even be infected by the virus, and if they were, most would
      be very unlikely to die from it? It has been estimated that people over 70
      are at least 10,000 times more likely to die from Covid-19 as those under
      15 years old. If the vaccines were actually useful and necessary, would
