      That’s how health journalist Helen Branswell recently described the
      vaccines that have saved millions of lives in the coronavirus pandemic.
      The vaccines, offered to the U.S. population, have proved to be 90 percent
      effective against infection. Ready within a year of the outbreak, they
      have proved to be safe. And they are widely available and free. There is
      no parallel in modern times. According to the Centers for Disease Control
      and Prevention, about 1 in 5 eligible Americans have yet to get their
      first vaccine dose. Millions of people remain unvaccinated. They were 14
      times more likely than the vaccinated to die of covid, as of December, the
      latest month for which data is available. How many of the 551,168 covid
      deaths in the United States since Jan. 1, 2021, could have been averted
      with vaccines? Too many. No more powerful case can be made than the voices
      of those who hesitated to get vaccinated and then faced the awful
      consequences.

      Can the dramatic increase in autism be ascribed to change in diagnostic
      practice? Data from the recent California report from the Office of
      Developmental Services belie this contention. The Figure 1 juxtaposes the
      data from California with those from north-west London. Identical temporal
      trends are shown, with the rise in autism from a steady baseline value,
      coinciding with the introduction of MMR vaccine as the single strategy in
      both countries that use the same diagnostic criteria for autism.

      Accordingly, in addition to its role in protecting them from serious
      diseases that are still lurking about, I consider vaccinating our children
      as part of a social contract we have with the communities we live in. When
      we vaccinate the majority of children, we create what is known as "herd
      immunity" that limits the spread of a disease through a population.
      Parents who do not vaccinate their children would seem to be apart from
      this social contract; in reality, though, they can safely refuse
      vaccination for their children only because most parents have accepted the
      risk of vaccination for their own children and thereby have raised the
      overall level of protective immunity. If we all spurned this contract, a
      new generation of children--our children--would be devastated by diseases
      that could be avoided. That would violate what I consider to be one of the
      most fundamental tenets of public health: children should not be harmed by
      things that can be prevented.

      Another concern stems from the fact that the COVID-19 vaccine causes our
      cells to produce the virus protein themselves, which is a feature of mRNA
      vaccines, rather than directly introducing the virus protein into the body
      like a traditional vaccine would.

      Beyond concerns about side effects, many of the hesitant just don’t have
      much trust in the vaccines. They may believe that the process for the
      vaccines was too fast — it was, after all, a record time from conception
      to mass production. They may note the vaccines aren’t even technically
      approved by the Food and Drug Administration since the agency has only
      authorized them for emergency use.

      For some, the concern is the vaccine itself — and particularly the side
      effects that can come with it. These concerns can be about something the
      vaccine really causes, like a day or two of aches, fever, and fatigue or,
      in extremely rare cases, potentially blood clots. But they can also be
      about things that aren’t real or proven, like other long-term health risks
      or unproven claims about, for example, infertility.

      The first reason relates to the view that healthcare is a matter of
      personal risk, choice, and responsibility. Many parents, across the
      spectrum of vaccination attitudes, hold this worldview. Yet some parents
      see this worldview as being in conflict with vaccination promotion
      messages. These messages emphasise population-level risk and community
      health. This perceived tension may lead some parents to be hesitant about
      vaccination for their children.

      The second reason relates to the impact of social exclusion. Exclusion can
      take many different forms: economic, political, and cultural. All these
      forms can lay the foundation for distrust, alienation, resentment, and
      demotivation. Parents who are socially excluded may be hesitant about
      vaccination because they distrust vaccines and those delivering them. Or
      it may be a form of resistance or a mechanism to bring about change. It
      may be that vaccination takes time and comes with opportunity costs for
      these parents.

      Opponents say that children’s immune systems can deal with most infections
      naturally, and that injecting questionable vaccine ingredients into a
      child may cause side effects, including seizures, paralysis, and death.
      They contend that numerous studies prove that vaccines may trigger
      problems like ADHD and diabetes.

      Most diseases that vaccines target are relatively harmless in many cases,
      thus making vaccines unnecessary. The chickenpox is often just a rash with
      blisters and can be treated with acetaminophen, cool compresses, and
      calamine lotion. The measles is normally a rash accompanied by a fever and
      runny nose and can be treated with rest and fluids. Rubella is often just
      a virus with a rash and low fever and can be treated with acetaminophen.
      Rotavirus can normally be treated with hydration and probiotics.

      Vaccinated individuals have accounted for 73 percent of all covid-19 cases
      in England over the past month and are the obvious driving factor for
      viral transmission. The vaccinated are also the ones crowding the
      hospitals. There were 2,341 unvaccinated hospitalizations last month (a
      number that is falling rapidly). However, there were 6,889
      hospitalizations for the vaccinated (a number that is rapidly increasing).
      Most of these hospitalizations are occurring in triply vaccinated
      individuals (4,936). In all, 75 percent of all Covid-19 hospitalizations
      are observed in the vaccinated. When it comes to fatalities, the
      unvaccinated cohort is improving. The unvaccinated accounted for 559
      deaths in the last reporting period and the vaccinated accounted for 4,302
      deaths, with the majority of fatalities occurring in the triply vaccinated
      (3,120). The vaccinated population now accounts for 90 percent of the
      deaths overall. The triply vaccinated account for 4 of every 5 of these
      fatalities! To put these figures in perspective, take a look at the Week
      51 Vaccine Surveillance Report for 2021. From November 22 to December 19,
      2021, there were 889 unvaccinated deaths and 2,913 vaccinated deaths. This
      shows that the fatality rate for the unvaccinated population is going
      down, while the fatality rate for the vaccinated population is getting
      severely worse. So, why hasn’t a strict moratorium been placed on this
      destructive vaccine?

      Thalidomide is a drug that was marketed as a treatment for morning
      sickness in pregnant women in the late 1950s and early 60s and later
      caused birth defects. This has understandably prompted distrust in
      government guidance on public health issues. However, Thalidomide is not
      comparable to a vaccine. Thalidomide went directly into the bloodstream,
      whereas the Covid-19 vaccine gives antibodies which help fight off the
      virus. Thalidomide was not properly tested and never went through the
      monitoring system as the coronavirus vaccine has done. Dr Ruth Blue, a
      consultant for the Thalidomide Society, said it was “a bit insulting that
      suddenly Thalidomide gets remembered after all these years when it suits
      anti-vaxxers to have something to compare to — but it isn’t a comparison.
      “The outcome of Thalidomide completely changed the way drugs are tested
      and are passed.” She added: “Vaccinations are a really fairly safe form of
      medicine. They have been around for a very long time. There have been very
      few problems with vaccinations over the years and it’s not really
      comparable. They are a tried and tested science and they have saved
      absolutely millions of lives. “Thalidomide did totally the opposite. It
      wasn’t tested, it wasn’t tried out and it destroyed millions of lives.”

      Parental refusal of vaccines is a growing a concern for the increased
      occurrence of vaccine preventable diseases in children. A number of
      studies have looked into the reasons that parents refuse, delay, or are
      hesitant to vaccinate their child(ren). These reasons vary widely between
      parents, but they can be encompassed in 4 overarching categories. The 4
      categories are religious reasons, personal beliefs or philosophical
      reasons, safety concerns, and a desire for more information from
      healthcare providers. Parental concerns about vaccines in each category
      lead to a wide spectrum of decisions varying from parents completely
      refusing all vaccinations to only delaying vaccinations so that they are
      more spread out. A large subset of parents admits to having concerns and
      questions about childhood vaccinations. For this reason, it can be helpful
      for pharmacists and other healthcare providers to understand the cited
      reasons for hesitancy so they are better prepared to educate their
      patients' families. Education is a key player in equipping parents with
      the necessary information so that they can make responsible immunization
      decisions for their children.

      Some people don’t get flu vaccines for themselves or for their children.
      There are several reasons for this, including: The flu vaccine doesn’t
      protect against all strains of the flu. The vaccination needs to be given
      every year. The vaccination could make them sick, which is false.

      In recent years there has been much controversy surrounding the MMR
      vaccine. Some people used to think the vaccine - which is a combined
      treatment against measles, mumps and rubella - could cause autism in
      children. They decided not to risk letting their child have the vaccine
      and hoped they would not catch measles, mumps or rubella.

      The three manufacturers, Pfizer, Moderna, And Johnson & Johnson have said
      don’t take their vaccines if you have allergies, you are pregnant or

      have heart disease, you have a fever, you have taken another vaccine, or
      if you are immunocompromised or on a medicine which affects your immune

      2.4.3.2. Antibodies Before the new discoveries of 2021, scientists’
      concerns about clotting and bleeding were based primarily on the
      prediction that killer T-cells would attack spike-producing endothelial
      cells, causing lesions on vessel linings and promoting blood clots. While
      this mechanism remains valid, we now know that a memory-type antibody
      response will join the attack on the vessel walls as well. Whereas killer
      T-cells attack their targets cell-to-cell, antibodies are proteins that
      exert their effect by binding to signature structures on the pathogen’s
      surface, known as epitopes. Instead of destroying cells directly, once
      attached to an epitope, antibodies help to defeat invaders by “calling out
      the cavalry” on infected cells. This leads to the second process by which
      cells coated with viral spikes will inadvertently come under immune
      attack. “Calling out the cavalry” means that the antibodies attached to
      the unnaturally created spikes will trigger activation of the complement
      system, which thereupon will mount a massive attack on the endothelial
      cells. Importantly for deciphering the recent discoveries on SARS-CoV-2
      immunity, the first time that the immune system encounters a new pathogen,
      new antibodies in a shape capable of binding to that pathogen’s epitopes
      must be formed (by immune cells known as B-cells). First-time antibody
      production is slow, taking approximately four weeks. Should the same
      pathogen or family of pathogens invade again, however, memory-type
      antibodies are then manufactured more rapidly, within one to two weeks.
      This is a cardinal sign that the immune system has seen that pathogen
      before. Another defining feature of a memory antibody response concerns
      the order in which antibody sub-types are produced. If a pathogen is new,
      IgM is the first type of antibody to arrive on the scene. It is followed
      later by IgG and IgA. The next time the pathogen arrives, however, IgG and
      IgA will be the first to arrive, indicating that the virus, or its
      relatives, have invaded before. Importantly, this is precisely what we see
      with COVID-19. Several research groups found in 2021 that upon first
      exposure to SARS-CoV-2, and following COVID-19 vaccination, the antibody
      response was characteristic of the memory type, due both to the timing and
      nature of antibodies measured. [xv-xvii] As a result, we now know that our
      immune systems recognise SARS-CoV-2 at first sight, even “on the slightest
      viral challenge” [5]. In other words, SARS-CoV-2 is not a novel
      coronavirus after all. With respect to variants and the need for booster
      shots, memory B-cells, like memory T-cells, can recognise not only a
      specific virus, but a whole family of viruses bearing related epitopes. It
      is unsurprising, therefore, that memory B-cells recognise SARS-CoV-2 from
      the common cold. With cross immunity this robust, closer relatives of
      SARS-CoV-2 in the form of variants will pose no obstacle to our antibody
      response. The rising “cases”, hospitalisations and deaths attributed to
      Delta and other variants are therefore almost certainly driven by false
      positive PCR results and misclassification than by a true increase in
      COVID-19 disease. Indeed, according to Public Health England data, the
      Delta variant is non- lethal in those under 50, and less than half as
      lethal as earlier strains in older age groups [26]. But why haven’t
      circulating antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 been detected in populations before?
      The answer is that neither the antibodies nor T-cells associated with a
      memory-type response circulate in the bloodstream. Once they are no longer
      needed, they become dormant, existing as a memory alone. Unless elicited
      by re-exposure to a virus, they remain invisible in the bloodstream. The
      dormant antibodies will, however, be ready and waiting to re-activate and
      call out the cavalry on the spike protein, in the form of the complement
      cascade.

      CLS is an extremely rare, serious condition that causes fluid to leak from
      small blood vessels (capillaries), causing rapid swelling of the arms and
      legs, sudden weight gain, feeling faint, thickening of the blood, low
      levels of albumin in the blood (an important blood protein) and low blood
      pressure. CLS is commonly associated with viral infections, some blood
      cancers, inflammatory diseases, and some treatments. CLS is already a
      known side effect of the AstraZeneca vector vaccine. The EMA examined 11
      reported cases of CLS after the Spikevax vaccination and 44 cases that
      occurred after the Comirnaty (Pfizer for BioNTech) shot. With Comirnaty
      more frequently used, its incidence rate occurred at a lower ratio. As a
      result, regulators concluded that only Spikevax required a warning of the
      disease. In addition, the regulators also claim there to be insufficient
      evidence to attribute these new CLS cases to the vaccines. Instead, they
      assert the Covid shot would likely only cause a resurgence of the disease.

      But once the novel coronavirus was discovered and sequenced in Wuhan,
      China, everything changed, nearly overnight. Within days, mRNA coronavirus
      vaccines were being widely acknowledged as one of our best bets against
      the virus. Scientists started using the technology to develop shots — on a
      breathtakingly rapid timeline. Suddenly, it seemed, everyone wanted to
      know who was responsible for this promising technique. If Malone is right
      about one thing pertaining to the mRNA vaccines, Geall said, it's that it
      is still important to keep researching these products and answering any
      yet unanswered questions about them, in addition to improving how and when
      they're used. "Would I have preferred that there had been 15 years of
      research and safety generation through clinical trials? Absolutely," Geall
      said. "But that wasn't an option during the pandemic." So he, and all the
      other scientists interviewed for this article, got vaccinated with the
      mRNA vaccines that they, Malone, and many others helped create over a

      One vaccine ingredient that has been studied specifically is thimerosal.
      Thimerosal is a mercury-based preservative used to prevent germs (like
      bacteria and fungi) from contaminating multidose vials of vaccines.
      Research shows that thimerosal does not cause ASD. In fact, a 2004
      scientific review by the IOM concluded that "the evidence favors rejection
      of a causal relationship between thimerosal–containing vaccines and

      Even if you’ve had COVID-19, experts recommend getting vaccinated — and
      boosted, if you’re eligible. One reason: It’s unclear how long you are
      protected from the disease after a previous infection. Another reason: New
      research suggests that the COVID-19 vaccines offer better protection than
      natural immunity and can help prevent reinfections.

      Some people have had concerns that ASD might be linked to the vaccines

      receiving vaccines and developing ASD. The National Academy of Medicine,

      Based on the extensive review presented, GACVS concluded that no evidence
      exists of a causal association between MMR vaccine and autism or autistic
      disorders. The Committee believes the matter is likely to be clarified by
      a better understanding of the causes of autism. GACVS also concluded that
      there is no evidence to support the routine use of monovalent measles,
      mumps and rubella vaccines over the combined vaccine, a strategy which
      would put children at increased risk of incomplete immunization. Thus,
      GACVS recommends that there should be no change in current vaccination

      The ingredients in vaccines are safe in the amounts used. Ingredients,
      such as thimerosal, formaldehyde, and aluminum, can be harmful in large
      doses but they are not used in harmful quantities in vaccines. Children
      are exposed to more aluminum in breast milk and infant formula than they
      are exposed to in vaccines. Paul Offit, MD, notes that children are
      exposed to more bacteria, viruses, toxins, and other harmful substances in
      one day of normal activity than are in vaccines. With the exception of
      inactivated flu vaccines, thimerosal (a mercury compound) has been removed
      or reduced to trace amounts in vaccines for children under 6 years old.
      The FDA requires up to 10 or more years of testing for all vaccines before
      they are licensed, and then they are monitored by the CDC and the FDA to
      make sure the vaccines and the ingredients used in the vaccines are safe.

      Vaccines can have side effects, that is a fact. But they may only be used
      if they have been extensively tested for safety by independent
      organisations. In the past there have been harmful side effects, but these
      were rare and did not outweigh the protection provided by the vaccines.
      Nowadays, researchers understand much better how vaccines exactly work.
      Therefore, modern vaccines are much safer than those in the past.

      So vaccines are NOT safe by design. Safety by testing ALONE, is an
      unacceptable strategy for such a safety critical product. And it is too
      late when the safety problems are detected in the general public, as is
      the case now and as clearly demonstrated by the Pandemrix induced
      narcolepsy disaster. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) lamented in 2012 that
      "for the majority of cases (135 vaccine-adverse event pairs), the evidence
      was inadequate to accept or reject a causal relationship." The evidence
      for vaccine safety claims simply does NOT exist. Many epidemiological
      vaccine safety studies make the basic mistake of declaring "lack of
      association" because the confidence interval of the odds ratio does not
      span the null value. These conclusions are simply wrong. Mechanistic

      For now, those who believe in the overwhelmingly debunked theories of
      vaccines remain in the minority. According to the CDC, in the United
      States, 95% of children in kindergarten have had vaccines for preventable
      diseases, including two doses of the MMR vaccine. But that figure is not
      uniform across the country. And top lawmakers recently sent a letter to
      Congress expressing their unqualified support for vaccines. Some state
      legislatures are trying to stamp out resistance to vaccines. In
      California, for instance, the state significantly limited the grounds on
      which a parent could opt out of vaccinating her children. California
      pediatrician, Branco, instituted a policy in 2012 that stated he will no
      longer see children who haven’t received the MMR vaccine by the age of
      two. He told the Examiner he understands it’s hard for parents to evaluate
      the evidence when they are hearing so many different anecdotes, but that
      he wants to keep his other vaccinated patients healthy. “I think people
      will fixate on the stories,” he said. “What is hard for parents to do is
      take a step back from the personal story and say what’s the real risk.”

      It is true that the production of all three of the leading candidates –
      the newly-approved Pfizer/BioNTech jab, Moderna and the Oxford/AstraZeneca
      vaccine – have achieved in less than ten months what usually takes a
      decade. But, despite the speed, none of these vaccine trials have actually
      skipped any steps. Instead, some of the stages overlapped. For example,
      phase three of the trial – when tens of thousands of trial participants
      were given the jab – commenced when phase two – which saw hundreds
      receiving the vaccine – was still ongoing. At a Downing Street press
      conference on Wednesday, Dr June Raine – the head of the UK’s regulatory
      agency which has given the Pfizer treatment the thumbs up – said no
      corners have been cut. “If you’re climbing a mountain, you prepare and
      prepare. We started that in June. By the time the interim results became
      available on 10 November we were at base camp,” she said. “And then when
      we got the final analysis we were ready for that last sprint that takes us
      to today.” Vaccine trials are usually held up by long periods of inertia –
      waiting for funding, resources and permissions to come through. But,
      because of the huge global stake in ending the pandemic, there was no
      waiting game. A huge amount of funding and support were poured into
      vaccine efforts across the world – and that’s brought us to where we are
      today. As for side effects, they usually show up in trials quickly after
      vaccination – while longer-term effects are very rare. So you don’t have
      anything to worry about on that front, either.

      and are passed.” She added: “Vaccinations are a really fairly safe form of
      medicine. They have been around for a very long time. There have been very
      few problems with vaccinations over the years and it’s not really
      comparable. They are a tried and tested science and they have saved
      absolutely millions of lives. “Thalidomide did totally the opposite. It
      wasn’t tested, it wasn’t tried out and it destroyed millions of lives.”

      COVID-19 vaccines have proven to be safe, effective and life-saving. Like
      all vaccines, they do not fully protect everyone who is vaccinated, and we
      do not yet know how well they can prevent people from transmitting the
      virus to others. So as well as getting vaccinated, we must also continue
      with other measures to fight the pandemic.

      Parental refusal of vaccines is a growing a concern for the increased
      occurrence of vaccine preventable diseases in children. A number of
      studies have looked into the reasons that parents refuse, delay, or are
      hesitant to vaccinate their child(ren). These reasons vary widely between
      parents, but they can be encompassed in 4 overarching categories. The 4
      categories are religious reasons, personal beliefs or philosophical
      reasons, safety concerns, and a desire for more information from
      healthcare providers. Parental concerns about vaccines in each category
      lead to a wide spectrum of decisions varying from parents completely
      refusing all vaccinations to only delaying vaccinations so that they are
      more spread out. A large subset of parents admits to having concerns and
      questions about childhood vaccinations. For this reason, it can be helpful
      for pharmacists and other healthcare providers to understand the cited
      reasons for hesitancy so they are better prepared to educate their
      patients' families. Education is a key player in equipping parents with
      the necessary information so that they can make responsible immunization
      decisions for their children.

      2.4.4. Enhancing the Severity of Wild Coronavirus Infection Finally, as
      with the Dengue virus and several other viruses [34], antibodies to
      coronaviruses can ultimately aggravate rather than mitigate illness. This
      is called antibody-dependent enhancement of disease. The underlying
      mechanisms remain to be elucidated but it is already clear that the net
      effects are severely detrimental. Attempts to develop vaccines to the
      original SARS virus, which is closely related to SARS-CoV-2, repeatedly
      failed due to antibody-dependent enhancement of disease [35–37]. The
      vaccines induced antibodies, but when the vaccinated animals were
      subsequently infected with the wild-type virus, they became more ill than
      the unvaccinated animals, in some cases mortally so [38].

      What is currently unknown is the ultimate impact of those burdens on
      future economic activity, which has been curtailed severely by social
      isolation. “That’s why, if and when a vaccine is developed, which most
      people expect to happen in the next year and a half,” Lichtenberg says,
      “the value to society will be in reducing these other burdens, and
      allowing the economy to get back to normal. Or at least a new normal.”
      Lichtenberg says it’s important that any new vaccine be fairly priced, but
      also that it is financially attractive for companies to invest heavily in
      research. “Given how valuable this would be to the world, providing
      financial incentives to industry is important,” Lichtenberg says. “We need
      to develop a safe and effective vaccine as quickly as possible.”

      6. Your kids have set an example. Most children don’t have a choice about
      getting shots. But why should they be the only one getting stuck with a
      needle? Want to show them that prevention through vaccination works? “Mom,
      dad, grandma, and grandpa should get their vaccinations just as children
      do,” Schaffner says.

      9. You’re going back to college. The downturn has forced many adults back
      to school. But many colleges require proof of routine vaccinations. You
      may not have those records. Your parents may not have those records. And
      your childhood doctor may no longer be practicing. It’s OK to repeat a
      vaccine. But, Wharton says, it’s “a hassle and cost” that could be
      prevented by keeping good records.

      Can the dramatic increase in autism be ascribed to change in diagnostic
      practice? Data from the recent California report from the Office of
      Developmental Services belie this contention. The Figure 1 juxtaposes the
      data from California with those from north-west London. Identical temporal
      trends are shown, with the rise in autism from a steady baseline value,
      coinciding with the introduction of MMR vaccine as the single strategy in
      both countries that use the same diagnostic criteria for autism.

      Severe side effects: we would also expect to see 1 to 2 people experience
      a severe complication like TTS. The risks of TTS are higher for younger
      people, especially those under 60 years. Anyone who develops severe
      headaches and tiredness up to 30 days after the first dose should seek
      medical help immediately. It’s important to know that even if someone
      becomes ill with TTS, doctors now have a better understanding of the
      condition. It’s much easier to diagnose and get the right treatment, so
      the chances of recovery are higher than they were before.

      Recent data suggest COVID-19 vaccines become less effective at preventing
      infection or severe illness over time, especially for people ages 65 years
      and older. This is why booster shots are recommended for people ages 12
      years and older who have completed their primary vaccination series.
      However, even as the vaccine’s ability to prevent infection decreases with
      time, COVID-19 vaccination continues to reduce the risk of hospitalization
      and death when people become infected with COVID-19.

      Most diseases that vaccines target are relatively harmless in many cases,
      thus making vaccines unnecessary. The chickenpox is often just a rash with
      blisters and can be treated with acetaminophen, cool compresses, and
      calamine lotion. The measles is normally a rash accompanied by a fever and
      runny nose and can be treated with rest and fluids. Rubella is often just
      a virus with a rash and low fever and can be treated with acetaminophen.
      Rotavirus can normally be treated with hydration and probiotics.

      “We will have a safety profile for only a certain number of months, so if
      there is a long-term effect after two years, we cannot know,” Brosh said,
      adding that we could wait two years to discover them, “but then we would
      have the coronavirus for two more years.” Linial expressed similar
      sentiments: “Classical vaccines were designed to take 10 years to develop.
      I don’t think the world can wait for a classical vaccine.” But when asked
      if she would take the vaccine right away, she responded: “I won’t be
      taking it immediately – probably not for at least the coming year,” she
      told the Post. “We have to wait and see whether it really works.”
