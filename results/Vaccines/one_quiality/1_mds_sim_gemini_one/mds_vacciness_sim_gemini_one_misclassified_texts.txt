      Can the dramatic increase in autism be ascribed to change in diagnostic
      practice? Data from the recent California report from the Office of
      Developmental Services belie this contention. The Figure 1 juxtaposes the
      data from California with those from north-west London. Identical temporal
      trends are shown, with the rise in autism from a steady baseline value,
      coinciding with the introduction of MMR vaccine as the single strategy in
      both countries that use the same diagnostic criteria for autism.

      The first reason relates to the view that healthcare is a matter of
      personal risk, choice, and responsibility. Many parents, across the
      spectrum of vaccination attitudes, hold this worldview. Yet some parents
      see this worldview as being in conflict with vaccination promotion
      messages. These messages emphasise population-level risk and community
      health. This perceived tension may lead some parents to be hesitant about
      vaccination for their children.

      The second reason relates to the impact of social exclusion. Exclusion can
      take many different forms: economic, political, and cultural. All these
      forms can lay the foundation for distrust, alienation, resentment, and
      demotivation. Parents who are socially excluded may be hesitant about
      vaccination because they distrust vaccines and those delivering them. Or
      it may be a form of resistance or a mechanism to bring about change. It
      may be that vaccination takes time and comes with opportunity costs for
      these parents.

      Vaccines are considered to be safe. They’re rigorously tested and go
      through many rounds of study, examination, and research before they’re
      used with the general public. The overwhelming bulk of research and
      evidence shows that vaccines are safe and that side effects are rare. Side
      effects that do occur are typically mild.

      Vaccines can have side effects, that is a fact. But they may only be used
      if they have been extensively tested for safety by independent
      organisations. In the past there have been harmful side effects, but these
      were rare and did not outweigh the protection provided by the vaccines.
      Nowadays, researchers understand much better how vaccines exactly work.
      Therefore, modern vaccines are much safer than those in the past.

      Research into immunisation has been based on the theory that the benefits
      of immunisation far outweigh the risks from delayed adverse events and so
      long term safety studies do not need to be performed. When looking at
      diabetes—only one potential chronic adverse event—we found that the rise
      in the prevalence of diabetes may more than offset the expected decline in
      long term complications of H influenzae meningitis. Thus diabetes induced
      by vaccine should not be considered a rare potential adverse event. The
      incidence of many other chronic immunological diseases, including asthma,
      allergies, and immune mediated cancers, has risen rapidly and may also be
      linked to immunisation.

      Any vaccine can cause side effects. Usually, these side effects are minor
      — a low-grade fever, fussiness and soreness at the injection site. Some
      vaccines cause a temporary headache, fatigue or loss of appetite. Rarely,
      a child might experience a severe allergic reaction or a neurological side
      effect, such as a seizure. Although these rare side effects are a concern,
      the risk of a vaccine causing serious harm or death is extremely small.
      The benefits of getting a vaccine are much greater than the possible side
      effects for almost all children.

      Vaccinated individuals have accounted for 73 percent of all covid-19 cases
      in England over the past month and are the obvious driving factor for
      viral transmission. The vaccinated are also the ones crowding the
      hospitals. There were 2,341 unvaccinated hospitalizations last month (a
      number that is falling rapidly). However, there were 6,889
      hospitalizations for the vaccinated (a number that is rapidly increasing).
      Most of these hospitalizations are occurring in triply vaccinated
      individuals (4,936). In all, 75 percent of all Covid-19 hospitalizations
      are observed in the vaccinated. When it comes to fatalities, the
      unvaccinated cohort is improving. The unvaccinated accounted for 559
      deaths in the last reporting period and the vaccinated accounted for 4,302
      deaths, with the majority of fatalities occurring in the triply vaccinated
      (3,120). The vaccinated population now accounts for 90 percent of the
      deaths overall. The triply vaccinated account for 4 of every 5 of these
      fatalities! To put these figures in perspective, take a look at the Week
      51 Vaccine Surveillance Report for 2021. From November 22 to December 19,
      2021, there were 889 unvaccinated deaths and 2,913 vaccinated deaths. This
      shows that the fatality rate for the unvaccinated population is going
      down, while the fatality rate for the vaccinated population is getting
      severely worse. So, why hasn’t a strict moratorium been placed on this
      destructive vaccine?

      It is true that the production of all three of the leading candidates –
      the newly-approved Pfizer/BioNTech jab, Moderna and the Oxford/AstraZeneca
      vaccine – have achieved in less than ten months what usually takes a
      decade. But, despite the speed, none of these vaccine trials have actually
      skipped any steps. Instead, some of the stages overlapped. For example,
      phase three of the trial – when tens of thousands of trial participants
      were given the jab – commenced when phase two – which saw hundreds
      receiving the vaccine – was still ongoing. At a Downing Street press
      conference on Wednesday, Dr June Raine – the head of the UK’s regulatory
      agency which has given the Pfizer treatment the thumbs up – said no
      corners have been cut. “If you’re climbing a mountain, you prepare and
      prepare. We started that in June. By the time the interim results became
      available on 10 November we were at base camp,” she said. “And then when
      we got the final analysis we were ready for that last sprint that takes us
      to today.” Vaccine trials are usually held up by long periods of inertia –
      waiting for funding, resources and permissions to come through. But,
      because of the huge global stake in ending the pandemic, there was no
      waiting game. A huge amount of funding and support were poured into
      vaccine efforts across the world – and that’s brought us to where we are
      today. As for side effects, they usually show up in trials quickly after
      vaccination – while longer-term effects are very rare. So you don’t have
      anything to worry about on that front, either.

      Thalidomide is a drug that was marketed as a treatment for morning
      sickness in pregnant women in the late 1950s and early 60s and later
      caused birth defects. This has understandably prompted distrust in
      government guidance on public health issues. However, Thalidomide is not
      comparable to a vaccine. Thalidomide went directly into the bloodstream,
      whereas the Covid-19 vaccine gives antibodies which help fight off the
      virus. Thalidomide was not properly tested and never went through the
      monitoring system as the coronavirus vaccine has done. Dr Ruth Blue, a
      consultant for the Thalidomide Society, said it was “a bit insulting that
      suddenly Thalidomide gets remembered after all these years when it suits
      anti-vaxxers to have something to compare to — but it isn’t a comparison.
      “The outcome of Thalidomide completely changed the way drugs are tested
      and are passed.” She added: “Vaccinations are a really fairly safe form of
      medicine. They have been around for a very long time. There have been very
      few problems with vaccinations over the years and it’s not really
      comparable. They are a tried and tested science and they have saved
      absolutely millions of lives. “Thalidomide did totally the opposite. It
      wasn’t tested, it wasn’t tried out and it destroyed millions of lives.”

      Vaccines are only given to children after a long and careful review by
      scientists, doctors, and healthcare professionals. Vaccines will involve
      some discomfort and may cause pain, redness, or tenderness at the site of
      injection but this is minimal compared to the pain, discomfort, and trauma
      of the diseases these vaccines prevent. Serious side effects following
      vaccination, such as severe allergic reaction, are very rare. The

      sentiments: “Classical vaccines were designed to take 10 years to develop.
      I don’t think the world can wait for a classical vaccine.” But when asked
      if she would take the vaccine right away, she responded: “I won’t be

      told the Post. “We have to wait and see whether it really works.”

      Based on the extensive review presented, GACVS concluded that no evidence
      exists of a causal association between MMR vaccine and autism or autistic
      disorders. The Committee believes the matter is likely to be clarified by
      a better understanding of the causes of autism. GACVS also concluded that
      there is no evidence to support the routine use of monovalent measles,
      mumps and rubella vaccines over the combined vaccine, a strategy which
      would put children at increased risk of incomplete immunization. Thus,
      GACVS recommends that there should be no change in current vaccination

      So vaccines are NOT safe by design. Safety by testing ALONE, is an
      unacceptable strategy for such a safety critical product. And it is too
      late when the safety problems are detected in the general public, as is
      the case now and as clearly demonstrated by the Pandemrix induced
      narcolepsy disaster. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) lamented in 2012 that
      "for the majority of cases (135 vaccine-adverse event pairs), the evidence
      was inadequate to accept or reject a causal relationship." The evidence
      for vaccine safety claims simply does NOT exist. Many epidemiological
      vaccine safety studies make the basic mistake of declaring "lack of
      association" because the confidence interval of the odds ratio does not
      span the null value. These conclusions are simply wrong. Mechanistic
      evidence clearly demonstrates vaccines cause food allergies, asthma⁠,
      autism and many autoimmune diseases including type 1 diabetes.

      In general, skipping vaccines isn't a good idea. This can leave your child
      vulnerable to potentially serious diseases that could otherwise be
      avoided. And consider this: For some children — including those who can't
      receive certain vaccines for medical reasons (such as cancer therapy) —
      the only protection from vaccine-preventable diseases is the immunity of
      the people around them. If immunization rates drop, vaccine-preventable

      There are unfortunate and disturbing reports that childhood vaccine
      administration is being disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic all over the

      also about resurgence of a host of other awful infectious diseases like

      Parental refusal of vaccines is a growing a concern for the increased
      occurrence of vaccine preventable diseases in children. A number of
      studies have looked into the reasons that parents refuse, delay, or are
      hesitant to vaccinate their child(ren). These reasons vary widely between
      parents, but they can be encompassed in 4 overarching categories. The 4
      categories are religious reasons, personal beliefs or philosophical
      reasons, safety concerns, and a desire for more information from
      healthcare providers. Parental concerns about vaccines in each category
      lead to a wide spectrum of decisions varying from parents completely
      refusing all vaccinations to only delaying vaccinations so that they are
      more spread out. A large subset of parents admits to having concerns and
      questions about childhood vaccinations. For this reason, it can be helpful
      for pharmacists and other healthcare providers to understand the cited
      reasons for hesitancy so they are better prepared to educate their
      patients' families. Education is a key player in equipping parents with
      the necessary information so that they can make responsible immunization

      hospitalization, in about one per 20,000 babies in the United States.
      Long-term seizures, coma, lowered consciousness, and permanent brain
