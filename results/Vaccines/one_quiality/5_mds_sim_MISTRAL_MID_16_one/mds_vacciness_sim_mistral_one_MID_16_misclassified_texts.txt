      That’s how health journalist Helen Branswell recently described the
      vaccines that have saved millions of lives in the coronavirus pandemic.
      The vaccines, offered to the U.S. population, have proved to be 90 percent
      effective against infection. Ready within a year of the outbreak, they
      have proved to be safe. And they are widely available and free. There is
      no parallel in modern times. According to the Centers for Disease Control
      and Prevention, about 1 in 5 eligible Americans have yet to get their
      first vaccine dose. Millions of people remain unvaccinated. They were 14
      times more likely than the vaccinated to die of covid, as of December, the
      latest month for which data is available. How many of the 551,168 covid
      deaths in the United States since Jan. 1, 2021, could have been averted
      with vaccines? Too many. No more powerful case can be made than the voices
      of those who hesitated to get vaccinated and then faced the awful
      consequences.

      Can the dramatic increase in autism be ascribed to change in diagnostic
      practice? Data from the recent California report from the Office of
      Developmental Services belie this contention. The Figure 1 juxtaposes the
      data from California with those from north-west London. Identical temporal
      trends are shown, with the rise in autism from a steady baseline value,
      coinciding with the introduction of MMR vaccine as the single strategy in
      both countries that use the same diagnostic criteria for autism.

      Another concern stems from the fact that the COVID-19 vaccine causes our
      cells to produce the virus protein themselves, which is a feature of mRNA
      vaccines, rather than directly introducing the virus protein into the body
      like a traditional vaccine would.

      The first reason relates to the view that healthcare is a matter of
      personal risk, choice, and responsibility. Many parents, across the
      spectrum of vaccination attitudes, hold this worldview. Yet some parents
      see this worldview as being in conflict with vaccination promotion
      messages. These messages emphasise population-level risk and community
      health. This perceived tension may lead some parents to be hesitant about
      vaccination for their children.

      The second reason relates to the impact of social exclusion. Exclusion can
      take many different forms: economic, political, and cultural. All these
      forms can lay the foundation for distrust, alienation, resentment, and
      demotivation. Parents who are socially excluded may be hesitant about
      vaccination because they distrust vaccines and those delivering them. Or
      it may be a form of resistance or a mechanism to bring about change. It
      may be that vaccination takes time and comes with opportunity costs for
      these parents.

      Most diseases that vaccines target are relatively harmless in many cases,
      thus making vaccines unnecessary. The chickenpox is often just a rash with
      blisters and can be treated with acetaminophen, cool compresses, and
      calamine lotion. The measles is normally a rash accompanied by a fever and
      runny nose and can be treated with rest and fluids. Rubella is often just
      a virus with a rash and low fever and can be treated with acetaminophen.
      Rotavirus can normally be treated with hydration and probiotics.

      Vaccinated individuals have accounted for 73 percent of all covid-19 cases
      in England over the past month and are the obvious driving factor for
      viral transmission. The vaccinated are also the ones crowding the
      hospitals. There were 2,341 unvaccinated hospitalizations last month (a
      number that is falling rapidly). However, there were 6,889
      hospitalizations for the vaccinated (a number that is rapidly increasing).
      Most of these hospitalizations are occurring in triply vaccinated
      individuals (4,936). In all, 75 percent of all Covid-19 hospitalizations
      are observed in the vaccinated. When it comes to fatalities, the
      unvaccinated cohort is improving. The unvaccinated accounted for 559
      deaths in the last reporting period and the vaccinated accounted for 4,302
      deaths, with the majority of fatalities occurring in the triply vaccinated
      (3,120). The vaccinated population now accounts for 90 percent of the
      deaths overall. The triply vaccinated account for 4 of every 5 of these
      fatalities! To put these figures in perspective, take a look at the Week
      51 Vaccine Surveillance Report for 2021. From November 22 to December 19,
      2021, there were 889 unvaccinated deaths and 2,913 vaccinated deaths. This
      shows that the fatality rate for the unvaccinated population is going
      down, while the fatality rate for the vaccinated population is getting
      severely worse. So, why hasn’t a strict moratorium been placed on this
      destructive vaccine?

      Thalidomide is a drug that was marketed as a treatment for morning
      sickness in pregnant women in the late 1950s and early 60s and later
      caused birth defects. This has understandably prompted distrust in
      government guidance on public health issues. However, Thalidomide is not
      comparable to a vaccine. Thalidomide went directly into the bloodstream,
      whereas the Covid-19 vaccine gives antibodies which help fight off the
      virus. Thalidomide was not properly tested and never went through the
      monitoring system as the coronavirus vaccine has done. Dr Ruth Blue, a
      consultant for the Thalidomide Society, said it was “a bit insulting that
      suddenly Thalidomide gets remembered after all these years when it suits
      anti-vaxxers to have something to compare to — but it isn’t a comparison.
      “The outcome of Thalidomide completely changed the way drugs are tested
      and are passed.” She added: “Vaccinations are a really fairly safe form of
      medicine. They have been around for a very long time. There have been very
      few problems with vaccinations over the years and it’s not really
      comparable. They are a tried and tested science and they have saved
      absolutely millions of lives. “Thalidomide did totally the opposite. It
      wasn’t tested, it wasn’t tried out and it destroyed millions of lives.”

      Parental refusal of vaccines is a growing a concern for the increased
      occurrence of vaccine preventable diseases in children. A number of
      studies have looked into the reasons that parents refuse, delay, or are
      hesitant to vaccinate their child(ren). These reasons vary widely between
      parents, but they can be encompassed in 4 overarching categories. The 4
      categories are religious reasons, personal beliefs or philosophical
      reasons, safety concerns, and a desire for more information from
      healthcare providers. Parental concerns about vaccines in each category
      lead to a wide spectrum of decisions varying from parents completely
      refusing all vaccinations to only delaying vaccinations so that they are
      more spread out. A large subset of parents admits to having concerns and
      questions about childhood vaccinations. For this reason, it can be helpful
      for pharmacists and other healthcare providers to understand the cited
      reasons for hesitancy so they are better prepared to educate their
      patients' families. Education is a key player in equipping parents with
      the necessary information so that they can make responsible immunization
      decisions for their children.

      Some people don’t get flu vaccines for themselves or for their children.
      There are several reasons for this, including: The flu vaccine doesn’t

      every year. The vaccination could make them sick, which is false.

      So vaccines are NOT safe by design. Safety by testing ALONE, is an
      unacceptable strategy for such a safety critical product. And it is too
      late when the safety problems are detected in the general public, as is
      the case now and as clearly demonstrated by the Pandemrix induced
      narcolepsy disaster. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) lamented in 2012 that
      "for the majority of cases (135 vaccine-adverse event pairs), the evidence
      was inadequate to accept or reject a causal relationship." The evidence
      for vaccine safety claims simply does NOT exist. Many epidemiological
      vaccine safety studies make the basic mistake of declaring "lack of
      association" because the confidence interval of the odds ratio does not
      span the null value. These conclusions are simply wrong. Mechanistic
      evidence clearly demonstrates vaccines cause food allergies, asthma⁠,
      autism and many autoimmune diseases including type 1 diabetes.

      2.4.3.2. Antibodies Before the new discoveries of 2021, scientists’
      concerns about clotting and bleeding were based primarily on the
      prediction that killer T-cells would attack spike-producing endothelial
      cells, causing lesions on vessel linings and promoting blood clots. While
      this mechanism remains valid, we now know that a memory-type antibody
      response will join the attack on the vessel walls as well. Whereas killer
      T-cells attack their targets cell-to-cell, antibodies are proteins that
      exert their effect by binding to signature structures on the pathogen’s
      surface, known as epitopes. Instead of destroying cells directly, once
      attached to an epitope, antibodies help to defeat invaders by “calling out
      the cavalry” on infected cells. This leads to the second process by which
      cells coated with viral spikes will inadvertently come under immune
      attack. “Calling out the cavalry” means that the antibodies attached to
      the unnaturally created spikes will trigger activation of the complement
      system, which thereupon will mount a massive attack on the endothelial
      cells. Importantly for deciphering the recent discoveries on SARS-CoV-2
      immunity, the first time that the immune system encounters a new pathogen,
      new antibodies in a shape capable of binding to that pathogen’s epitopes
      must be formed (by immune cells known as B-cells). First-time antibody
      production is slow, taking approximately four weeks. Should the same
      pathogen or family of pathogens invade again, however, memory-type
      antibodies are then manufactured more rapidly, within one to two weeks.
      This is a cardinal sign that the immune system has seen that pathogen
      before. Another defining feature of a memory antibody response concerns
      the order in which antibody sub-types are produced. If a pathogen is new,
      IgM is the first type of antibody to arrive on the scene. It is followed
      later by IgG and IgA. The next time the pathogen arrives, however, IgG and
      IgA will be the first to arrive, indicating that the virus, or its
      relatives, have invaded before. Importantly, this is precisely what we see
      with COVID-19. Several research groups found in 2021 that upon first
      exposure to SARS-CoV-2, and following COVID-19 vaccination, the antibody
      response was characteristic of the memory type, due both to the timing and
      nature of antibodies measured. [xv-xvii] As a result, we now know that our
      immune systems recognise SARS-CoV-2 at first sight, even “on the slightest
      viral challenge” [5]. In other words, SARS-CoV-2 is not a novel
      coronavirus after all. With respect to variants and the need for booster
      shots, memory B-cells, like memory T-cells, can recognise not only a
      specific virus, but a whole family of viruses bearing related epitopes. It
      is unsurprising, therefore, that memory B-cells recognise SARS-CoV-2 from
      the common cold. With cross immunity this robust, closer relatives of
      SARS-CoV-2 in the form of variants will pose no obstacle to our antibody
      response. The rising “cases”, hospitalisations and deaths attributed to
      Delta and other variants are therefore almost certainly driven by false
      positive PCR results and misclassification than by a true increase in
      COVID-19 disease. Indeed, according to Public Health England data, the
      Delta variant is non- lethal in those under 50, and less than half as
      lethal as earlier strains in older age groups [26]. But why haven’t
      circulating antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 been detected in populations before?
      The answer is that neither the antibodies nor T-cells associated with a
      memory-type response circulate in the bloodstream. Once they are no longer
      needed, they become dormant, existing as a memory alone. Unless elicited
      by re-exposure to a virus, they remain invisible in the bloodstream. The
      dormant antibodies will, however, be ready and waiting to re-activate and
      call out the cavalry on the spike protein, in the form of the complement
      cascade.

      2.4.3.3. Complement Recent findings indicate that complement activation is
      a serious concern with respect to COVID-19 vaccine-immune interactions. In
      light of the newly characterised antibody response to SARS-CoV-2, when
      antibodies attach to spike- producing endothelial cells on vessel walls
      following vaccine administration, activated complement proteins can be
      expected attach to the endothelial cells, and perforate their cell
      membranes [27,28]. The ensuing death of the endothelial cells will expose
      the tissue underneath the epithelium, which will initiate two significant
      events. It will induce blood clotting, and will cause the vessel walls to
      leak [6]. This pathogenic mechanism has been documented in biopsies taken
      from SARS-CoV-2-infected patients [19,29]. Those studies have described a
      “catastrophic microvascular injury syndrome mediated by activation of
      complement” [29] as part of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein immune response.
      It is precisely this immune response that COVID-19 vaccines seek to
      induce. Such vaccine-immune interactions are consistent with adverse
      events involving visible capillary rupture under the skin that have been
      documented and reported following COVID-19 vaccination [30–33].

      2.4.4. Enhancing the Severity of Wild Coronavirus Infection Finally, as
      with the Dengue virus and several other viruses [34], antibodies to
      coronaviruses can ultimately aggravate rather than mitigate illness. This
      is called antibody-dependent enhancement of disease. The underlying
      mechanisms remain to be elucidated but it is already clear that the net
      effects are severely detrimental. Attempts to develop vaccines to the
      original SARS virus, which is closely related to SARS-CoV-2, repeatedly
      failed due to antibody-dependent enhancement of disease [35–37]. The
      vaccines induced antibodies, but when the vaccinated animals were
      subsequently infected with the wild-type virus, they became more ill than
      the unvaccinated animals, in some cases mortally so [38].

      “We will have a safety profile for only a certain number of months, so if
      there is a long-term effect after two years, we cannot know,” Brosh said,
      adding that we could wait two years to discover them, “but then we would
      have the coronavirus for two more years.” Linial expressed similar
      sentiments: “Classical vaccines were designed to take 10 years to develop.
      I don’t think the world can wait for a classical vaccine.” But when asked
      if she would take the vaccine right away, she responded: “I won’t be
      taking it immediately – probably not for at least the coming year,” she
      told the Post. “We have to wait and see whether it really works.”

      prevented by keeping good records.

      Recent data suggest COVID-19 vaccines become less effective at preventing
      infection or severe illness over time, especially for people ages 65 years
      and older. This is why booster shots are recommended for people ages 12
      years and older who have completed their primary vaccination series.
      However, even as the vaccine’s ability to prevent infection decreases with
      time, COVID-19 vaccination continues to reduce the risk of hospitalization
