      But once the novel coronavirus was discovered and sequenced in Wuhan,
      China, everything changed, nearly overnight. Within days, mRNA coronavirus
      vaccines were being widely acknowledged as one of our best bets against
      the virus. Scientists started using the technology to develop shots — on a
      breathtakingly rapid timeline. Suddenly, it seemed, everyone wanted to
      know who was responsible for this promising technique. If Malone is right
      about one thing pertaining to the mRNA vaccines, Geall said, it's that it
      is still important to keep researching these products and answering any
      yet unanswered questions about them, in addition to improving how and when
      they're used. "Would I have preferred that there had been 15 years of
      research and safety generation through clinical trials? Absolutely," Geall
      said. "But that wasn't an option during the pandemic." So he, and all the
      other scientists interviewed for this article, got vaccinated with the
      mRNA vaccines that they, Malone, and many others helped create over a
      30-year period.

      Vaccine trials often take years because not only do they need to recruit a
      lot of participants to be able to evaluate safety and efficacy, they then
      need to wait for natural infections to take place. The COVID-19 vaccine
      trials have moved along faster thanks to extra financial support from the
      government and other funding sources, and the high prevalence of the virus
      in the community, said Boslett. “They didn’t skip any steps.” More than
      40,000 people were enrolled in the Pfizer vaccine trials, and more than
      30,000 in the Moderna vaccine trials. “That’s a lot of people, but if the
      virus were rare, that still wouldn’t be enough people,” said Boslett. “But
      because the virus is running so rampant throughout the U.S. and other
      places in the world, this was actually a good number of people to show a
      difference between the vaccinated and unvaccinated groups.” The mRNA
      technology, which has undergone years of study for other potential
      vaccines, was another time-saver. Compared to vaccines that use live
      viruses, mRNA vaccines are relatively easy to manufacture. “Virus is
      actually hard to grow,” said Boslett. “The fact that this wasn’t a live
      vaccine allowed the manufacturing to be a little bit simpler.”

      One vaccine ingredient that has been studied specifically is thimerosal.
      Thimerosal is a mercury-based preservative used to prevent germs (like
      bacteria and fungi) from contaminating multidose vials of vaccines.
      Research shows that thimerosal does not cause ASD. In fact, a 2004
      scientific review by the IOM concluded that "the evidence favors rejection
      of a causal relationship between thimerosal–containing vaccines and
      autism."

      But clinical trial results demonstrate the vaccine’s safety in young
      children. Research published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM)
      and funded by BNT162b2 makers Pfizer and BioNTech found no serious
      vaccine-related adverse effects among the 1517 fully vaccinated 5- to
      11-year-old participants. After a median 2.3-month follow-up, the
      researchers concluded that BNT162b2 is safe, immunogenic, and effective
      for the young age group they studied.

      The first reason relates to the view that healthcare is a matter of
      personal risk, choice, and responsibility. Many parents, across the
      spectrum of vaccination attitudes, hold this worldview. Yet some parents
      see this worldview as being in conflict with vaccination promotion
      messages. These messages emphasise population-level risk and community
      health. This perceived tension may lead some parents to be hesitant about
      vaccination for their children.

      The second reason relates to the impact of social exclusion. Exclusion can
      take many different forms: economic, political, and cultural. All these
      forms can lay the foundation for distrust, alienation, resentment, and
      demotivation. Parents who are socially excluded may be hesitant about
      vaccination because they distrust vaccines and those delivering them. Or
      it may be a form of resistance or a mechanism to bring about change. It
      may be that vaccination takes time and comes with opportunity costs for
      these parents.

      Opponents say that children’s immune systems can deal with most infections
      naturally, and that injecting questionable vaccine ingredients into a
      child may cause side effects, including seizures, paralysis, and death.
      They contend that numerous studies prove that vaccines may trigger
      problems like ADHD and diabetes.

      The ingredients in vaccines are safe in the amounts used. Ingredients,
      such as thimerosal, formaldehyde, and aluminum, can be harmful in large
      doses but they are not used in harmful quantities in vaccines. Children
      are exposed to more aluminum in breast milk and infant formula than they
      are exposed to in vaccines. Paul Offit, MD, notes that children are
      exposed to more bacteria, viruses, toxins, and other harmful substances in
      one day of normal activity than are in vaccines. With the exception of
      inactivated flu vaccines, thimerosal (a mercury compound) has been removed
      or reduced to trace amounts in vaccines for children under 6 years old.
      The FDA requires up to 10 or more years of testing for all vaccines before
      they are licensed, and then they are monitored by the CDC and the FDA to
      make sure the vaccines and the ingredients used in the vaccines are safe.

      Major medical organizations state that vaccines are safe. These

      Most diseases that vaccines target are relatively harmless in many cases,
      thus making vaccines unnecessary. The chickenpox is often just a rash with
      blisters and can be treated with acetaminophen, cool compresses, and
      calamine lotion. The measles is normally a rash accompanied by a fever and
      runny nose and can be treated with rest and fluids. Rubella is often just
      a virus with a rash and low fever and can be treated with acetaminophen.
      Rotavirus can normally be treated with hydration and probiotics.

      Vaccines are considered to be safe. They’re rigorously tested and go
      through many rounds of study, examination, and research before they’re
      used with the general public. The overwhelming bulk of research and
      evidence shows that vaccines are safe and that side effects are rare. Side
      effects that do occur are typically mild.

      COVID-19 vaccines have been shown to be safe and effective. Rigorous
      testing has demonstrated the safety of the COVID-19 vaccines and the
      Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) continue to monitor for
      safety concerns. All available vaccines are effective at preventing severe
      disease, hospitalization and death caused by COVID-19.

      Vaccines can have side effects, that is a fact. But they may only be used
      if they have been extensively tested for safety by independent
      organisations. In the past there have been harmful side effects, but these
      were rare and did not outweigh the protection provided by the vaccines.
      Nowadays, researchers understand much better how vaccines exactly work.
      Therefore, modern vaccines are much safer than those in the past.

      It is true that the production of all three of the leading candidates –
      the newly-approved Pfizer/BioNTech jab, Moderna and the Oxford/AstraZeneca
      vaccine – have achieved in less than ten months what usually takes a
      decade. But, despite the speed, none of these vaccine trials have actually
      skipped any steps. Instead, some of the stages overlapped. For example,
      phase three of the trial – when tens of thousands of trial participants
      were given the jab – commenced when phase two – which saw hundreds
      receiving the vaccine – was still ongoing. At a Downing Street press
      conference on Wednesday, Dr June Raine – the head of the UK’s regulatory
      agency which has given the Pfizer treatment the thumbs up – said no
      corners have been cut. “If you’re climbing a mountain, you prepare and
      prepare. We started that in June. By the time the interim results became
      available on 10 November we were at base camp,” she said. “And then when
      we got the final analysis we were ready for that last sprint that takes us
      to today.” Vaccine trials are usually held up by long periods of inertia –
      waiting for funding, resources and permissions to come through. But,
      because of the huge global stake in ending the pandemic, there was no
      waiting game. A huge amount of funding and support were poured into
      vaccine efforts across the world – and that’s brought us to where we are
      today. As for side effects, they usually show up in trials quickly after
      vaccination – while longer-term effects are very rare. So you don’t have
      anything to worry about on that front, either.

      Thalidomide is a drug that was marketed as a treatment for morning
      sickness in pregnant women in the late 1950s and early 60s and later
      caused birth defects. This has understandably prompted distrust in
      government guidance on public health issues. However, Thalidomide is not
      comparable to a vaccine. Thalidomide went directly into the bloodstream,
      whereas the Covid-19 vaccine gives antibodies which help fight off the
      virus. Thalidomide was not properly tested and never went through the
      monitoring system as the coronavirus vaccine has done. Dr Ruth Blue, a
      consultant for the Thalidomide Society, said it was “a bit insulting that
      suddenly Thalidomide gets remembered after all these years when it suits
      anti-vaxxers to have something to compare to — but it isn’t a comparison.
      “The outcome of Thalidomide completely changed the way drugs are tested
      and are passed.” She added: “Vaccinations are a really fairly safe form of
      medicine. They have been around for a very long time. There have been very
      few problems with vaccinations over the years and it’s not really
      comparable. They are a tried and tested science and they have saved
      absolutely millions of lives. “Thalidomide did totally the opposite. It
      wasn’t tested, it wasn’t tried out and it destroyed millions of lives.”

      Parental refusal of vaccines is a growing a concern for the increased
      occurrence of vaccine preventable diseases in children. A number of
      studies have looked into the reasons that parents refuse, delay, or are
      hesitant to vaccinate their child(ren). These reasons vary widely between
      parents, but they can be encompassed in 4 overarching categories. The 4
      categories are religious reasons, personal beliefs or philosophical
      reasons, safety concerns, and a desire for more information from
      healthcare providers. Parental concerns about vaccines in each category
      lead to a wide spectrum of decisions varying from parents completely
      refusing all vaccinations to only delaying vaccinations so that they are
      more spread out. A large subset of parents admits to having concerns and
      questions about childhood vaccinations. For this reason, it can be helpful
      for pharmacists and other healthcare providers to understand the cited
      reasons for hesitancy so they are better prepared to educate their
      patients' families. Education is a key player in equipping parents with
      the necessary information so that they can make responsible immunization
      decisions for their children.

      Proponents of vaccine mandates typically claim that everyone who can be
      vaccinated has a moral or ethical obligation to do so for the sake of
      those who cannot be vaccinated, or in the interest of public health. I
      evaluate several previously undertheorised premises implicit to the
      ‘obligation to vaccinate’ type of arguments and show that the general
      conclusion is false: there is neither a moral obligation to vaccinate nor
      a sound ethical basis to mandate vaccination under any circumstances, even
      for hypothetical vaccines that are medically risk-free. Agent autonomy
      with respect to self-constitution has absolute normative priority over
      reduction or elimination of the associated risks to life. In practical
      terms, mandatory vaccination amounts to discrimination against healthy,
      innate biological characteristics, which goes against the established
      ethical norms and is also defeasible a priori.

      Some people don’t get flu vaccines for themselves or for their children.
      There are several reasons for this, including: The flu vaccine doesn’t

      In recent years there has been much controversy surrounding the MMR
      vaccine. Some people used to think the vaccine - which is a combined
      treatment against measles, mumps and rubella - could cause autism in
      children. They decided not to risk letting their child have the vaccine
      and hoped they would not catch measles, mumps or rubella.

      Covid-19 is a coronavirus (like a cold). ALL coronaviruses can be
      prevented and treated through more natural methods. All viruses mutate.
      This means that to be “protected”, you must continually accept new
      experimental vaccines or boosters. Most people who have taken the
      vaccines, have done so out of fear or were bullied by society, corporate
      America, or the government. Most people who have refused the vaccines,
      have done so because of a lack of evidence for safety or effectiveness.
      (Or, because they understand a great many things on this list.) Young
      healthy people have a 99.9% chance of surviving Covid-19, if they even
      contract the virus. Why is it that those promoting the vaccines for
      children, demand that school children wear masks which are scientifically

      2.4.3.2. Antibodies Before the new discoveries of 2021, scientists’
      concerns about clotting and bleeding were based primarily on the
      prediction that killer T-cells would attack spike-producing endothelial
      cells, causing lesions on vessel linings and promoting blood clots. While
      this mechanism remains valid, we now know that a memory-type antibody
      response will join the attack on the vessel walls as well. Whereas killer
      T-cells attack their targets cell-to-cell, antibodies are proteins that
      exert their effect by binding to signature structures on the pathogen’s
      surface, known as epitopes. Instead of destroying cells directly, once
      attached to an epitope, antibodies help to defeat invaders by “calling out
      the cavalry” on infected cells. This leads to the second process by which
      cells coated with viral spikes will inadvertently come under immune
      attack. “Calling out the cavalry” means that the antibodies attached to
      the unnaturally created spikes will trigger activation of the complement
      system, which thereupon will mount a massive attack on the endothelial
      cells. Importantly for deciphering the recent discoveries on SARS-CoV-2
      immunity, the first time that the immune system encounters a new pathogen,
      new antibodies in a shape capable of binding to that pathogen’s epitopes
      must be formed (by immune cells known as B-cells). First-time antibody
      production is slow, taking approximately four weeks. Should the same
      pathogen or family of pathogens invade again, however, memory-type
      antibodies are then manufactured more rapidly, within one to two weeks.
      This is a cardinal sign that the immune system has seen that pathogen
      before. Another defining feature of a memory antibody response concerns
      the order in which antibody sub-types are produced. If a pathogen is new,
      IgM is the first type of antibody to arrive on the scene. It is followed
      later by IgG and IgA. The next time the pathogen arrives, however, IgG and
      IgA will be the first to arrive, indicating that the virus, or its
      relatives, have invaded before. Importantly, this is precisely what we see
      with COVID-19. Several research groups found in 2021 that upon first
      exposure to SARS-CoV-2, and following COVID-19 vaccination, the antibody
      response was characteristic of the memory type, due both to the timing and
      nature of antibodies measured. [xv-xvii] As a result, we now know that our
      immune systems recognise SARS-CoV-2 at first sight, even “on the slightest
      viral challenge” [5]. In other words, SARS-CoV-2 is not a novel
      coronavirus after all. With respect to variants and the need for booster
      shots, memory B-cells, like memory T-cells, can recognise not only a
      specific virus, but a whole family of viruses bearing related epitopes. It
      is unsurprising, therefore, that memory B-cells recognise SARS-CoV-2 from
      the common cold. With cross immunity this robust, closer relatives of
      SARS-CoV-2 in the form of variants will pose no obstacle to our antibody
      response. The rising “cases”, hospitalisations and deaths attributed to
      Delta and other variants are therefore almost certainly driven by false
      positive PCR results and misclassification than by a true increase in
      COVID-19 disease. Indeed, according to Public Health England data, the
      Delta variant is non- lethal in those under 50, and less than half as
      lethal as earlier strains in older age groups [26]. But why haven’t
      circulating antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 been detected in populations before?
      The answer is that neither the antibodies nor T-cells associated with a
      memory-type response circulate in the bloodstream. Once they are no longer
      needed, they become dormant, existing as a memory alone. Unless elicited
      by re-exposure to a virus, they remain invisible in the bloodstream. The
      dormant antibodies will, however, be ready and waiting to re-activate and
      call out the cavalry on the spike protein, in the form of the complement
      cascade.

      Health care providers are the absolute best source for health information
      “When folks are hesitant about getting the vaccine, the first thing I
      recommend is to talk to a trusted health care provider who knows them
      best. Those questions and concerns are usually very personal and related
      to individual health conditions,” said Dr. Simonsen. “I want people to
      talk with a health provider that knows them well. But I also encourage
      everyone to ask those questions and go forward with getting the vaccine.
      It's safe. It's been delivered to millions in the U.S. at this point,
      including millions of kids, and we need to get more of our kids vaccinated
      to help get through this pandemic.” Research on the COVID-19 vaccine began
      in 2003 thanks to the SARS virus, COVID-19's cousin. The process used to
      develop the vaccine in 2020 was previously designed to make and test
      vaccines quickly in case of an infectious disease pandemic. “We have a
      long history of vaccinating kids to keep them healthy — from polio to
      measles and pertussis. As physicians, we know vaccine safety. We know the
      long-term side effects, short-term side effects and what to expect,” said
      Dr. Stoolman. “We understand that the vaccine can cause anxiety. That is
      why we're working to provide resources, support and education for families
      with questions and concerns. We are here for you,” said Emily Braun, M.D.,

      What is currently unknown is the ultimate impact of those burdens on
      future economic activity, which has been curtailed severely by social
      isolation. “That’s why, if and when a vaccine is developed, which most
      people expect to happen in the next year and a half,” Lichtenberg says,
      “the value to society will be in reducing these other burdens, and
      allowing the economy to get back to normal. Or at least a new normal.”
      Lichtenberg says it’s important that any new vaccine be fairly priced, but
      also that it is financially attractive for companies to invest heavily in
      research. “Given how valuable this would be to the world, providing
      financial incentives to industry is important,” Lichtenberg says. “We need
      to develop a safe and effective vaccine as quickly as possible.”

      “The first time your body sees the spike protein, it activates some immune
      system cells to begin to recognize and develop antibodies against that
      protein,” said Boslett. The response may be similar whether that first
      encounter is from infection with the virus or from the first dose of the
      vaccine. Studies of the mRNA vaccines suggest that one dose may offer
      between 50 to 80 percent protection against symptomatic COVID-19, though
      more data is needed, said Boslett. “We know you get some amount of
      protection after one dose of the vaccine or after infection with the
      virus, but we don’t know in either case how long that protection lasts,”
      she said. Some cases of reinfection have been reported after three to six
      months, so the protection from one dose of the vaccine also may wane in
      that timeframe. “However, when you get the second dose of the vaccine,
      you’re further training your immune system,” said Boslett. “You’re
      strengthening that response from the antibody-producing B cells and you’re
      also activating T memory cells that stick around for much longer.” Getting
      both doses of the vaccine means your body is shown this spike protein
      multiple times in a short duration. “So that immune response might be
      bigger, better and longer lasting than just getting the infection one
      time,” she said. Because the booster effect is so important, Boslett adds
      that this is why people who have had COVID-19 are still recommended to get
      the vaccine.

      Some vaccines, such as the measles or oral polio vaccines, contain a
      weakened form of the live virus, and in very rare cases these can cause
      disease. “But this isn’t one of those,” said Boslett. “The mRNA vaccines
      just contain a message that encodes the spike protein. It is not a live
      virus, so there’s no chance that the vaccine can give you COVID.” Some
      people may feel symptoms such as fever or muscle aches after the vaccines,
      but those are due to your body’s immune response, not an infection. “That
      is actually not a bad thing because that means that your body is producing
      an inflammatory response to the vaccine, which is what we want.”

      infection or severe illness over time, especially for people ages 65 years
      and older. This is why booster shots are recommended for people ages 12
      years and older who have completed their primary vaccination series.
      However, even as the vaccine’s ability to prevent infection decreases with
      time, COVID-19 vaccination continues to reduce the risk of hospitalization
      and death when people become infected with COVID-19.

      Viruses are constantly changing, including the virus that causes COVID-19.
      These changes occur over time and can lead to the emergence of variants
      that may have new characteristics. Vaccines continue to reduce a person's
      risk of contracting the virus that cause COVID-19. Vaccines are highly
      effective against severe illness.

      Even if you’ve had COVID-19, experts recommend getting vaccinated — and
      boosted, if you’re eligible. One reason: It’s unclear how long you are
      protected from the disease after a previous infection. Another reason: New
      research suggests that the COVID-19 vaccines offer better protection than
      natural immunity and can help prevent reinfections.

      Most diseases that vaccines target are relatively harmless in many cases,
      thus making vaccines unnecessary. The chickenpox is often just a rash with
      blisters and can be treated with acetaminophen, cool compresses, and
      calamine lotion. The measles is normally a rash accompanied by a fever and
      runny nose and can be treated with rest and fluids. Rubella is often just
      a virus with a rash and low fever and can be treated with acetaminophen.
      Rotavirus can normally be treated with hydration and probiotics.

      So vaccines are NOT safe by design. Safety by testing ALONE, is an
      unacceptable strategy for such a safety critical product. And it is too
      late when the safety problems are detected in the general public, as is
      the case now and as clearly demonstrated by the Pandemrix induced
      narcolepsy disaster. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) lamented in 2012 that
      "for the majority of cases (135 vaccine-adverse event pairs), the evidence
      was inadequate to accept or reject a causal relationship." The evidence
      for vaccine safety claims simply does NOT exist. Many epidemiological
      vaccine safety studies make the basic mistake of declaring "lack of
      association" because the confidence interval of the odds ratio does not
      span the null value. These conclusions are simply wrong. Mechanistic
      evidence clearly demonstrates vaccines cause food allergies, asthma⁠,
      autism and many autoimmune diseases including type 1 diabetes.

      Research into immunisation has been based on the theory that the benefits
      of immunisation far outweigh the risks from delayed adverse events and so
      long term safety studies do not need to be performed. When looking at
      diabetes—only one potential chronic adverse event—we found that the rise
      in the prevalence of diabetes may more than offset the expected decline in
      long term complications of H influenzae meningitis. Thus diabetes induced
      by vaccine should not be considered a rare potential adverse event. The
      incidence of many other chronic immunological diseases, including asthma,
      allergies, and immune mediated cancers, has risen rapidly and may also be
      linked to immunisation.

      COVID-19 vaccines have proven to be safe, effective and life-saving. Like
      all vaccines, they do not fully protect everyone who is vaccinated, and we
      do not yet know how well they can prevent people from transmitting the
      virus to others. So as well as getting vaccinated, we must also continue

      A new study has also found a reduction in transmission rates even after

      lower than those who have not been vaccinated. Those receiving the vaccine

      and the body's natural immunity are not enough to fight the virus and its
      emerging variants. Dr-Stoolman-at-Press-Conference.jpg Sharon Stoolman,

      We're going to need a poncho, rain pants and boots because the natural

      Some vaccines, such as the measles or oral polio vaccines, contain a
      weakened form of the live virus, and in very rare cases these can cause
      disease. “But this isn’t one of those,” said Boslett. “The mRNA vaccines
      just contain a message that encodes the spike protein. It is not a live
      virus, so there’s no chance that the vaccine can give you COVID.” Some
      people may feel symptoms such as fever or muscle aches after the vaccines,
      but those are due to your body’s immune response, not an infection. “That

      One vaccine ingredient that has been studied specifically is thimerosal.
      Thimerosal is a mercury-based preservative used to prevent germs (like
      bacteria and fungi) from contaminating multidose vials of vaccines.
      Research shows that thimerosal does not cause ASD. In fact, a 2004
      scientific review by the IOM concluded that "the evidence favors rejection
      of a causal relationship between thimerosal–containing vaccines and

      Vaccines do not give you a disease. Instead, they teach your body's immune
      system to recognise and fight the infection they have been designed to
      protect against. Some people do experience mild to moderate symptoms after
      being vaccinated. This is not the disease itself, but the body's response
      to the vaccine. Common reactions that may affect more than one in 10
      people and typically get better within days include chills, tiredness and

      Beyond concerns about side effects, many of the hesitant just don’t have
      much trust in the vaccines. They may believe that the process for the
      vaccines was too fast — it was, after all, a record time from conception
      to mass production. They may note the vaccines aren’t even technically
      approved by the Food and Drug Administration since the agency has only

      The ingredients in vaccines are safe in the amounts used. Ingredients,
      such as thimerosal, formaldehyde, and aluminum, can be harmful in large
      doses but they are not used in harmful quantities in vaccines. Children
      are exposed to more aluminum in breast milk and infant formula than they
      are exposed to in vaccines. Paul Offit, MD, notes that children are
      exposed to more bacteria, viruses, toxins, and other harmful substances in
      one day of normal activity than are in vaccines. With the exception of
      inactivated flu vaccines, thimerosal (a mercury compound) has been removed
      or reduced to trace amounts in vaccines for children under 6 years old.
      The FDA requires up to 10 or more years of testing for all vaccines before
      they are licensed, and then they are monitored by the CDC and the FDA to
      make sure the vaccines and the ingredients used in the vaccines are safe.

      The official narrative is collapsing. The winter of 2022 was supposed to
      be a “winter of death” for the unvaccinated. However, the unvaccinated
      makeup only 27 percent of the caseload, 25 percent of hospitalizations,
      and roughly 10 percent of the deaths in England now. The United Kingdom is
      officially living in a pandemic of the “fully vaccinated.” To make matters
      worse, deaths continue to surge for populations that are triply
      vaccinated, proving that the third shot is not an immune booster in the
      slightest. This third shot is just another inflammatory dose of spike
      proteins – a game of Russian roulette that causes more blood clots and
      heart inflammation, leading to further immune system depletion, sickness
      and death. While the Week 8 report paints a harrowing picture of vaccine
      failure, vaccine damage and propaganda exposed, the report also states,
      “this raw data should not be used to estimate vaccine effectiveness.” In
      other words, the raw data should be ignored and the covid-19 vaccination
      narrative should still be blindly and arrogantly believed. According to
      the data, roughly 400,000 unvaccinated people tested positive for covid-19
      and over one million VACCINATED people tested positive. A total of 752,126
      of these cases were recorded in triply vaccinated individuals. This data
      is shocking because the unvaccinated are the ones who are typically
      coerced to take covid-19 PCR tests as a prerequisite to interact with the
      public. If the unvaccinated want to partake in certain public events and
      travel, they are more likely to be contact traced and forcibly swabbed as
      if they have no freedom or due process rights.

      Covid-19 is a coronavirus (like a cold). ALL coronaviruses can be
      prevented and treated through more natural methods. All viruses mutate.
      This means that to be “protected”, you must continually accept new
      experimental vaccines or boosters. Most people who have taken the
      vaccines, have done so out of fear or were bullied by society, corporate
      America, or the government. Most people who have refused the vaccines,
      have done so because of a lack of evidence for safety or effectiveness.
      (Or, because they understand a great many things on this list.) Young
      healthy people have a 99.9% chance of surviving Covid-19, if they even
      contract the virus. Why is it that those promoting the vaccines for
      children, demand that school children wear masks which are scientifically
      proven to be useless against a virus, but proven to inhibit the immune

      After 2 years of Covid ravaging America, less than 1 in 7 people have
      statistically been known to contract the virus. That number is even less

      reinfections “rare” when desiring high numbers of cases, but “likely” when
      referring to the un-vaccinated? Why would 100% of the population have to
      take an experimental medical treatment, when the vast majority will
      probably never even be infected by the virus, and if they were, most would
      be very unlikely to die from it? It has been estimated that people over 70
      are at least 10,000 times more likely to die from Covid-19 as those under
      15 years old. If the vaccines were actually useful and necessary, would

      These vaccines, by definition, are not vaccines, but medical treatments.
      It is against the law for anyone to force a person to take a medical

      why are you required to declare the manufacturers not liable for injury or

      But what about the second and third waves of “cases”, including from Delta
      and other variants, around the world? It is important to understand that a
      COVID-19 “case”, as currently defined, does not correspond to being ill.
      To an unprecedented extent in medical history, rather than referring to
      actual disease, the term “case” has become conflated with nothing more
      than a positive Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test result. While PCR
      tests are useful in laboratory research and as diagnostic tools when
      carefully performed, they are not reliable or appropriate when used in
      isolation, nor set at extremely high sensitivities, nor in poorly trained
      hands, as has been the case overwhelmingly for COVID-19. It has long been
      known that reliance on PCR tests alone to define medical “cases” and
      causes of death results in “overdiagnosis, overtreatment, and increased
      health care costs” [21]. If PCR alone were used to diagnose an infection
      with the diarrhoeal pathogen Clostridium difficile (CD), for instance, an
      epidemic of CD would immediately appear. We would find, based on PCR
      results, that 50% of people in long term care, and 15% of those
      hospitalised for any reason, are CD “cases” [22]. Should they die of any
      cause following a positive PCR test for CD, they would be recorded as
      “dying with” CD. That figure could conceivably approach 100% if PCR tests
      were performed at the high sensitivities, or cycle thresholds, routinely
      employed when testing for COVID-19, in which the sensitivity of the test
      has been dialled up to meaningless extremes [23]. Horeover, even if we
      accepted PCR alone as a diagnostically appropriate tool—and therefore the
      high number of “cases” that it generates—we would still necessarily infer
      a very low infection fatality rate for COVID-19. This supports rather than
      contradicts the reality that SARS-CoV-2 poses no significant threat to the
      immunocompetent. In short, thanks to population immunity, for the vast
      majority of us, a “case” does not equate to severe disease.

      2.4.3.2. Antibodies Before the new discoveries of 2021, scientists’
      concerns about clotting and bleeding were based primarily on the
      prediction that killer T-cells would attack spike-producing endothelial
      cells, causing lesions on vessel linings and promoting blood clots. While
      this mechanism remains valid, we now know that a memory-type antibody
      response will join the attack on the vessel walls as well. Whereas killer
      T-cells attack their targets cell-to-cell, antibodies are proteins that
      exert their effect by binding to signature structures on the pathogen’s
      surface, known as epitopes. Instead of destroying cells directly, once
      attached to an epitope, antibodies help to defeat invaders by “calling out
      the cavalry” on infected cells. This leads to the second process by which
      cells coated with viral spikes will inadvertently come under immune
      attack. “Calling out the cavalry” means that the antibodies attached to
      the unnaturally created spikes will trigger activation of the complement
      system, which thereupon will mount a massive attack on the endothelial
      cells. Importantly for deciphering the recent discoveries on SARS-CoV-2
      immunity, the first time that the immune system encounters a new pathogen,
      new antibodies in a shape capable of binding to that pathogen’s epitopes
      must be formed (by immune cells known as B-cells). First-time antibody
      production is slow, taking approximately four weeks. Should the same
      pathogen or family of pathogens invade again, however, memory-type
      antibodies are then manufactured more rapidly, within one to two weeks.
      This is a cardinal sign that the immune system has seen that pathogen
      before. Another defining feature of a memory antibody response concerns
      the order in which antibody sub-types are produced. If a pathogen is new,
      IgM is the first type of antibody to arrive on the scene. It is followed
      later by IgG and IgA. The next time the pathogen arrives, however, IgG and
      IgA will be the first to arrive, indicating that the virus, or its
      relatives, have invaded before. Importantly, this is precisely what we see
      with COVID-19. Several research groups found in 2021 that upon first
      exposure to SARS-CoV-2, and following COVID-19 vaccination, the antibody
      response was characteristic of the memory type, due both to the timing and
      nature of antibodies measured. [xv-xvii] As a result, we now know that our
      immune systems recognise SARS-CoV-2 at first sight, even “on the slightest
      viral challenge” [5]. In other words, SARS-CoV-2 is not a novel
      coronavirus after all. With respect to variants and the need for booster
      shots, memory B-cells, like memory T-cells, can recognise not only a
      specific virus, but a whole family of viruses bearing related epitopes. It
      is unsurprising, therefore, that memory B-cells recognise SARS-CoV-2 from
      the common cold. With cross immunity this robust, closer relatives of
      SARS-CoV-2 in the form of variants will pose no obstacle to our antibody
      response. The rising “cases”, hospitalisations and deaths attributed to
      Delta and other variants are therefore almost certainly driven by false
      positive PCR results and misclassification than by a true increase in
      COVID-19 disease. Indeed, according to Public Health England data, the
      Delta variant is non- lethal in those under 50, and less than half as
      lethal as earlier strains in older age groups [26]. But why haven’t
      circulating antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 been detected in populations before?
      The answer is that neither the antibodies nor T-cells associated with a
      memory-type response circulate in the bloodstream. Once they are no longer
      needed, they become dormant, existing as a memory alone. Unless elicited
      by re-exposure to a virus, they remain invisible in the bloodstream. The
      dormant antibodies will, however, be ready and waiting to re-activate and
      call out the cavalry on the spike protein, in the form of the complement
      cascade.

      Implications for Doctors and Patients Although vaccine manufacturers and
      regulators are aware of the risks of antibody enhancement of disease, this
      possibility was not adequately addressed in the clinical trials on any of
      the COVID-19 vaccines. The FDA noted that Pfizer, “identified
      vaccine-associated enhanced disease, including vaccine-associated enhanced
      respiratory disease, as an important potential risk” [23]. The EMA
      similarly acknowledged that “vaccine associated enhanced respiratory
      disease” was “an important potential risk… that may be specific to
      vaccination for COVID- 19”. Why neither regulator sought to exclude such
      dangers prior to emergency use authorisation is an open question that all
      doctors and patients are entitled to ask. Why medical regulators failed to
      investigate the finding that large vaccine particles cross blood vessel
      walls, entering the bloodstream and posing risks of blood clotting and
      leaky vessels is yet another open question again. The fact that vaccine
      rollout began before the immune profile of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19
      vaccines had been adequately delineated is symptomatic of a rushed and
      highly politicised approach to the approval and regulation of COVID-19
      vaccines. As is the lack of clinical trials investigating the safety of
      COVID- 19 booster shots. In this context, it is up to doctors and patients
      to uphold the social contract of the doctor-patient relationship, and take
      medical prudence and patient safety into their own hands. The World
      Medical Association, Declaration of Geneva, Physician’s Pledge states
      [39]: “The health and wellbeing of my patient will be my first
      consideration. I will maintain the utmost respect for human life. I will
      practise my profession with conscience and dignity and in accordance with
      good medical practice. I will respect the autonomy and dignity of my
      patient. I will not use my medical knowledge to violate human rights and
      civil liberties, even under threat.”

      “We will have a safety profile for only a certain number of months, so if
      there is a long-term effect after two years, we cannot know,” Brosh said,
      adding that we could wait two years to discover them, “but then we would
      have the coronavirus for two more years.” Linial expressed similar
      sentiments: “Classical vaccines were designed to take 10 years to develop.
      I don’t think the world can wait for a classical vaccine.” But when asked
      if she would take the vaccine right away, she responded: “I won’t be
      taking it immediately – probably not for at least the coming year,” she
      told the Post. “We have to wait and see whether it really works.”
