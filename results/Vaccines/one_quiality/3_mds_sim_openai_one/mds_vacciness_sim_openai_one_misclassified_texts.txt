      Can the dramatic increase in autism be ascribed to change in diagnostic
      practice? Data from the recent California report from the Office of
      Developmental Services belie this contention. The Figure 1 juxtaposes the
      data from California with those from north-west London. Identical temporal
      trends are shown, with the rise in autism from a steady baseline value,
      coinciding with the introduction of MMR vaccine as the single strategy in
      both countries that use the same diagnostic criteria for autism.

      Accordingly, in addition to its role in protecting them from serious
      diseases that are still lurking about, I consider vaccinating our children
      as part of a social contract we have with the communities we live in. When
      we vaccinate the majority of children, we create what is known as "herd
      immunity" that limits the spread of a disease through a population.
      Parents who do not vaccinate their children would seem to be apart from
      this social contract; in reality, though, they can safely refuse
      vaccination for their children only because most parents have accepted the
      risk of vaccination for their own children and thereby have raised the
      overall level of protective immunity. If we all spurned this contract, a
      new generation of children--our children--would be devastated by diseases
      that could be avoided. That would violate what I consider to be one of the
      most fundamental tenets of public health: children should not be harmed by
      things that can be prevented.

      Most diseases that vaccines target are relatively harmless in many cases,
      thus making vaccines unnecessary. The chickenpox is often just a rash with
      blisters and can be treated with acetaminophen, cool compresses, and
      calamine lotion. The measles is normally a rash accompanied by a fever and
      runny nose and can be treated with rest and fluids. Rubella is often just
      a virus with a rash and low fever and can be treated with acetaminophen.
      Rotavirus can normally be treated with hydration and probiotics.

      In general, skipping vaccines isn't a good idea. This can leave your child
      vulnerable to potentially serious diseases that could otherwise be
      avoided. And consider this: For some children — including those who can't
      receive certain vaccines for medical reasons (such as cancer therapy) —
      the only protection from vaccine-preventable diseases is the immunity of
      the people around them. If immunization rates drop, vaccine-preventable
      diseases might once again become common threats.

      Vaccinated individuals have accounted for 73 percent of all covid-19 cases
      in England over the past month and are the obvious driving factor for
      viral transmission. The vaccinated are also the ones crowding the
      hospitals. There were 2,341 unvaccinated hospitalizations last month (a
      number that is falling rapidly). However, there were 6,889
      hospitalizations for the vaccinated (a number that is rapidly increasing).
      Most of these hospitalizations are occurring in triply vaccinated
      individuals (4,936). In all, 75 percent of all Covid-19 hospitalizations
      are observed in the vaccinated. When it comes to fatalities, the
      unvaccinated cohort is improving. The unvaccinated accounted for 559
      deaths in the last reporting period and the vaccinated accounted for 4,302
      deaths, with the majority of fatalities occurring in the triply vaccinated
      (3,120). The vaccinated population now accounts for 90 percent of the
      deaths overall. The triply vaccinated account for 4 of every 5 of these
      fatalities! To put these figures in perspective, take a look at the Week
      51 Vaccine Surveillance Report for 2021. From November 22 to December 19,
      2021, there were 889 unvaccinated deaths and 2,913 vaccinated deaths. This
      shows that the fatality rate for the unvaccinated population is going
      down, while the fatality rate for the vaccinated population is getting
      severely worse. So, why hasn’t a strict moratorium been placed on this
      destructive vaccine?

      Thalidomide is a drug that was marketed as a treatment for morning
      sickness in pregnant women in the late 1950s and early 60s and later
      caused birth defects. This has understandably prompted distrust in
      government guidance on public health issues. However, Thalidomide is not
      comparable to a vaccine. Thalidomide went directly into the bloodstream,
      whereas the Covid-19 vaccine gives antibodies which help fight off the
      virus. Thalidomide was not properly tested and never went through the
      monitoring system as the coronavirus vaccine has done. Dr Ruth Blue, a
      consultant for the Thalidomide Society, said it was “a bit insulting that
      suddenly Thalidomide gets remembered after all these years when it suits
      anti-vaxxers to have something to compare to — but it isn’t a comparison.
      “The outcome of Thalidomide completely changed the way drugs are tested
      and are passed.” She added: “Vaccinations are a really fairly safe form of
      medicine. They have been around for a very long time. There have been very
      few problems with vaccinations over the years and it’s not really
      comparable. They are a tried and tested science and they have saved
      absolutely millions of lives. “Thalidomide did totally the opposite. It

      There are unfortunate and disturbing reports that childhood vaccine
      administration is being disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic all over the
      world. This is worrisome because it would mean that not only would we
      worry about coronavirus resurgence after social distancing is relaxed, but
      also about resurgence of a host of other awful infectious diseases like
      polio and measles. During the pandemic we should continue to vaccinate,
      and continue to provide for children those things needed to protect their
      well-being. This is challenging, but important.

      Parental refusal of vaccines is a growing a concern for the increased
      occurrence of vaccine preventable diseases in children. A number of
      studies have looked into the reasons that parents refuse, delay, or are
      hesitant to vaccinate their child(ren). These reasons vary widely between
      parents, but they can be encompassed in 4 overarching categories. The 4
      categories are religious reasons, personal beliefs or philosophical
      reasons, safety concerns, and a desire for more information from
      healthcare providers. Parental concerns about vaccines in each category
      lead to a wide spectrum of decisions varying from parents completely
      refusing all vaccinations to only delaying vaccinations so that they are
      more spread out. A large subset of parents admits to having concerns and
      questions about childhood vaccinations. For this reason, it can be helpful
      for pharmacists and other healthcare providers to understand the cited
      reasons for hesitancy so they are better prepared to educate their
      patients' families. Education is a key player in equipping parents with
      the necessary information so that they can make responsible immunization
      decisions for their children.

      Some people don’t get flu vaccines for themselves or for their children.
      There are several reasons for this, including: The flu vaccine doesn’t

      Perhaps the most pertinent finding is that, due to the discovery of a
      widespread memory-type antibody response to SARS-CoV-2, the antibodies
      induced by the COVID-19 vaccines can be expected to activate the so-called
      complement system. This can bring about the destruction of any cell that
      manufactures the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, particularly in the
      circulation. If that happens to the endothelia, that is, the cell layer
      that lines the inner surfaces of our blood vessels, then those vessels may
      begin to leak [6] and clots will form. Given that 2021 research showed the
      spike protein to enter the bloodstream shortly after vaccination [5], this
      dangerous endothelial involvement in spike-production is highly likely,
      and should be expected to occur. As stark as these medical realities may
      be, the silver lining is that the same antibody profile, along with
      previously documented T-cell immunity [7–11], protects around 99% of the
      population against life- threatening SARS-CoV-2 infections. This ties in
      with the known fact that over 99% of people are safe from death with
      COVID-19 [12–14].

      2.4.3.2. Antibodies Before the new discoveries of 2021, scientists’
      concerns about clotting and bleeding were based primarily on the
      prediction that killer T-cells would attack spike-producing endothelial
      cells, causing lesions on vessel linings and promoting blood clots. While
      this mechanism remains valid, we now know that a memory-type antibody
      response will join the attack on the vessel walls as well. Whereas killer
      T-cells attack their targets cell-to-cell, antibodies are proteins that
      exert their effect by binding to signature structures on the pathogen’s
      surface, known as epitopes. Instead of destroying cells directly, once
      attached to an epitope, antibodies help to defeat invaders by “calling out
      the cavalry” on infected cells. This leads to the second process by which
      cells coated with viral spikes will inadvertently come under immune
      attack. “Calling out the cavalry” means that the antibodies attached to
      the unnaturally created spikes will trigger activation of the complement
      system, which thereupon will mount a massive attack on the endothelial
      cells. Importantly for deciphering the recent discoveries on SARS-CoV-2
      immunity, the first time that the immune system encounters a new pathogen,
      new antibodies in a shape capable of binding to that pathogen’s epitopes
      must be formed (by immune cells known as B-cells). First-time antibody
      production is slow, taking approximately four weeks. Should the same
      pathogen or family of pathogens invade again, however, memory-type
      antibodies are then manufactured more rapidly, within one to two weeks.
      This is a cardinal sign that the immune system has seen that pathogen
      before. Another defining feature of a memory antibody response concerns
      the order in which antibody sub-types are produced. If a pathogen is new,
      IgM is the first type of antibody to arrive on the scene. It is followed
      later by IgG and IgA. The next time the pathogen arrives, however, IgG and
      IgA will be the first to arrive, indicating that the virus, or its
      relatives, have invaded before. Importantly, this is precisely what we see
      with COVID-19. Several research groups found in 2021 that upon first
      exposure to SARS-CoV-2, and following COVID-19 vaccination, the antibody
      response was characteristic of the memory type, due both to the timing and
      nature of antibodies measured. [xv-xvii] As a result, we now know that our
      immune systems recognise SARS-CoV-2 at first sight, even “on the slightest
      viral challenge” [5]. In other words, SARS-CoV-2 is not a novel
      coronavirus after all. With respect to variants and the need for booster
      shots, memory B-cells, like memory T-cells, can recognise not only a
      specific virus, but a whole family of viruses bearing related epitopes. It
      is unsurprising, therefore, that memory B-cells recognise SARS-CoV-2 from
      the common cold. With cross immunity this robust, closer relatives of
      SARS-CoV-2 in the form of variants will pose no obstacle to our antibody
      response. The rising “cases”, hospitalisations and deaths attributed to
      Delta and other variants are therefore almost certainly driven by false
      positive PCR results and misclassification than by a true increase in
      COVID-19 disease. Indeed, according to Public Health England data, the
      Delta variant is non- lethal in those under 50, and less than half as
      lethal as earlier strains in older age groups [26]. But why haven’t
      circulating antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 been detected in populations before?
      The answer is that neither the antibodies nor T-cells associated with a
      memory-type response circulate in the bloodstream. Once they are no longer
      needed, they become dormant, existing as a memory alone. Unless elicited
      by re-exposure to a virus, they remain invisible in the bloodstream. The
      dormant antibodies will, however, be ready and waiting to re-activate and
      call out the cavalry on the spike protein, in the form of the complement
      cascade.

      “We're seeing a trend; kids who are not yet vaccinated are getting
      COVID-19 and becoming severely ill and hospitalized,” said Kari Simonsen,
      M.D., an infectious disease specialist and pediatrician-in-chief at
      Children's Hospital & Medical Center. “Vaccinating kids against COVID-19
      benefits our whole community because there will be fewer illnesses in
      children and fewer illnesses in the adults that they are around.” While
      case numbers have continued to fluctuate, previous spikes of COVID-19
      cases have caused disruptions in care for individuals with non-COVID-19
      health needs. As more families become vaccinated against COVID-19 to
      prevent severe illness, it alleviates strain on community health care
      systems. “If I didn't believe in the vaccine, I wouldn't have gotten it
      for my children. It reduces the spread of COVID-19 and the risk of severe
      symptoms. It also is safe for children. There has been plenty of research
      on it in the last two years,” said Anna Warnes, APRN, who serves as a
      family medical practitioner in Crete and Wilber, Nebraska.

      What is currently unknown is the ultimate impact of those burdens on
      future economic activity, which has been curtailed severely by social
      isolation. “That’s why, if and when a vaccine is developed, which most
      people expect to happen in the next year and a half,” Lichtenberg says,
      “the value to society will be in reducing these other burdens, and
      allowing the economy to get back to normal. Or at least a new normal.”
      Lichtenberg says it’s important that any new vaccine be fairly priced, but
      also that it is financially attractive for companies to invest heavily in
      research. “Given how valuable this would be to the world, providing
      financial incentives to industry is important,” Lichtenberg says. “We need
      to develop a safe and effective vaccine as quickly as possible.”

      So vaccines are NOT safe by design. Safety by testing ALONE, is an
      unacceptable strategy for such a safety critical product. And it is too
      late when the safety problems are detected in the general public, as is
      the case now and as clearly demonstrated by the Pandemrix induced
      narcolepsy disaster. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) lamented in 2012 that
      "for the majority of cases (135 vaccine-adverse event pairs), the evidence
      was inadequate to accept or reject a causal relationship." The evidence
      for vaccine safety claims simply does NOT exist. Many epidemiological
      vaccine safety studies make the basic mistake of declaring "lack of
      association" because the confidence interval of the odds ratio does not
      span the null value. These conclusions are simply wrong. Mechanistic
      evidence clearly demonstrates vaccines cause food allergies, asthma⁠,

      Research into immunisation has been based on the theory that the benefits
      of immunisation far outweigh the risks from delayed adverse events and so
      long term safety studies do not need to be performed. When looking at
      diabetes—only one potential chronic adverse event—we found that the rise
      in the prevalence of diabetes may more than offset the expected decline in
      long term complications of H influenzae meningitis. Thus diabetes induced
      by vaccine should not be considered a rare potential adverse event. The
      incidence of many other chronic immunological diseases, including asthma,
      allergies, and immune mediated cancers, has risen rapidly and may also be

      Covid-19 is a coronavirus (like a cold). ALL coronaviruses can be
      prevented and treated through more natural methods. All viruses mutate.
      This means that to be “protected”, you must continually accept new
      experimental vaccines or boosters. Most people who have taken the
      vaccines, have done so out of fear or were bullied by society, corporate
      America, or the government. Most people who have refused the vaccines,
      have done so because of a lack of evidence for safety or effectiveness.
      (Or, because they understand a great many things on this list.) Young
      healthy people have a 99.9% chance of surviving Covid-19, if they even
      contract the virus. Why is it that those promoting the vaccines for
