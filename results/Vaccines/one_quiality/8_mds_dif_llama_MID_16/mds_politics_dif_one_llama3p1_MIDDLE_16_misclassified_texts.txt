      The Deocratic platform has a strong emphasis on the shift to clean energy,
      which Democrats say can also lower Americans' energy costs and create more
      jobs. Here's what the goals include: Incentivize investment in
      transmission line upgrades and new lines, which move wind and solar energy
      from where they're generated to where people live. Scale up development of
      clean energy on public lands. Invest in clean energy research and

      New Democrats are committed to advancing real solutions that reduce health
      care costs for families and seniors, increase choices for consumers, and
      encourage participation by the young and healthy. To stabilize health
      insurance markets and bring down the cost of healthcare for all Americans,
      New Dems believe we must create a permanent reinsurance program, reduce
      healthcare costs for low-income Americans, promote greater insurance
      coverage, create a greater number of affordable insurance options, and
      improve the marketplaces. New Democrats have sought ways to work with

      The Republican Party in the Trump era remained a mostly pro-business party

      working class and populist, with many Romney Republicans drifting into the
      Democratic coalition....much of corporate America has swung culturally
      into liberalism’s camp. That process was well underway a decade ago, but
      it’s been accelerated by anti-Trump backlash, the more left-leaning
      commitments of big business’s younger customers and (especially) younger
      employees, and the relative ease with which the radical-sounding language
      of identity politics can be assimilated to corporate management
      techniques. As a consequence, today’s G.O.P. is most clearly now the party
      of local capitalism — the small-business gentry, the family firms.... Much
      of the party elite wish to continue doing business with big business as
      before. But the party’s base regards corporate institutions — especially

      Republicans are prioritizing the American people over the Democrat’s
      radical climate agenda. On his first day in office, President Biden
      started the war on American energy. He has revoked the permit for the
      Keystone XL pipeline, imposed a moratorium on oil production on federal
      lands, directed agencies across the Federal government to impose punitive
      and burdensome regulations, and made us more reliant on China.
      Predictably, gas prices skyrocketed to the highest levels in American
      history. People are counting on us to improve their quality of life. H.R.

      The Democratic Party is generally considered more willing to intervene in
      the economy, believing that government power is needed to regulate
      businesses that ignore social interests in the pursuit of earning a return
      for shareholders. This intervention can come in the form of regulation
      (such as limits on carbon emissions) or taxation to support social
      programs. Opponents often describe the Democratic approach to governing as
      tax and spend.

      It is good that our leaders recognize the importance of creating a healthy

      The first obligation of the federal government is to provide for the
      “common defense” of the United States by securing our borders and
      protecting our homeland and our strategic interests abroad. We are not
      “the world’s police force,” but because America serves in a natural role

      invites aggression, we must remain the strongest military power on

      Religiously affiliated institutions broadly. A wide range of religiously
      affiliated institutions have asserted that they have a legal and even
      constitutional right to be exempted from government requirements, even
      those designed to prevent discrimination. Those claims have not been
      limited to decisions in hiring ministers and others with clearly religious
      duties. Rather, institutions have often demanded that they be allowed to
      discriminate on religious grounds even when hiring staff to fulfill
      government grants. Moreover, institutions have insisted that they be
      allowed to discriminate against LGBTQ individuals in regard to employment;
      to ignore same-sex marriages in providing employee benefits; to fire
      employees who have used abortion care, contraceptives or assisted

      Building the wall has long been one of Trump’s signature promises, but its
      impacts beyond political symbolism are unclear. Illegal border crossings
      have plunged since Trump took office in January amid a string of orders on

      asylum meant tens of thousands of people who would’ve surrendered to law

      everywhere.Republican lawmakers are banning masks in schools. Iowa,
      Tennessee, Utah, Texas, Florida, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Arizona and South
      Carolina are prohibiting public schools from requiring students wear them.
      Republican states are on the way to outlawing abortions. Texas has just
      banned abortions after six weeks of pregnancy, before many women even know
      they’re pregnant. Other Republican states are on the way to enacting
      similar measures.

      Most importantly, policies must respect religious beliefs without harming
      or infringing on the rights of others. Through options like the examples
      below, policymakers can create the framework for a balanced, inclusive
      vision of religious liberty throughout the United States.

      Collectively, these provisions reflect a Republican strategy focused on
      limiting federal health spending, enforcing eligibility requirements and
      shifting coverage options toward market-based solutions.

      The party opposes a government-run single-payer health care system,
      claiming it constitutes socialized medicine. It favors a personal or
      employer-based system of insurance supplemented by Medicare for the
      elderly and Medicaid which covers approximately 40% of the poor.[citation

      Modernization Act with bipartisan support creating Medicare Part D
      covering prescription drugs. It was signed into law by President George W.
      Bush.

      Building the wall has long been one of Trump’s signature promises, but its
      impacts beyond political symbolism are unclear. Illegal border crossings
      have plunged since Trump took office in January amid a string of orders on
      immigration, including the suspension of the asylum system. Simply ending
      asylum meant tens of thousands of people who would’ve surrendered to law
      enforcement instead of trying to avoid capture didn’t even attempt to
      cross. Plus, the effectiveness of border walls is hotly debated, even in
      populated areas where barriers tend to be heavily reinforced. Human
      smugglers, often linked to drug cartels, have used tunnels, ladders and
      power tools to cross walls.

      The party favors limited legal immigration but strongly opposes illegal

      House Republicans are proposing legislation that would reduce federal
      taxes by $3.8 trillion over 10 years, with a disproportionate share of tax
      breaks going to the wealthy. The legislation would partially offset that
      revenue loss with reduced spending of $1.1 trillion over 10 years—$1.5
      trillion in spending cuts that include deep and harmful cuts to nutrition
      assistance and health care for low-income households,

      Republicans are prioritizing the American people over the Democrat’s
      radical climate agenda. On his first day in office, President Biden
      started the war on American energy. He has revoked the permit for the
      Keystone XL pipeline, imposed a moratorium on oil production on federal
      lands, directed agencies across the Federal government to impose punitive
      and burdensome regulations, and made us more reliant on China.
      Predictably, gas prices skyrocketed to the highest levels in American
      history. People are counting on us to improve their quality of life. H.R.
      1 delivers on that promise and will ensure America continues to lead the
      world at reducing emissions. I commend the passing of this package, which
      will boost energy production, lift regulatory burdens for the construction
      of more energy infrastructure, cut China out of our critical materials
      supply chains, and lower costs across the board. H.R. 1 is how we build a
      better and more secure future for all Americans.

      Two trends make domestic production an urgent priority. The first is the
      high cost of energy, which is burdening all of us. In the last four years,
      gasoline, electricity, and natural gas prices have risen by nearly a
      third. Removing restrictions on our energy companies can bring down these
      ballooning costs

      Modern Conservative Economic Policies are deeply rooted in the principles
      of free-market capitalism, which emphasizes minimal government
      intervention in the economy. By advocating for tax cuts and deregulation,
      these policies aim to empower individuals and businesses to operate freely
      without burdensome regulations. This approach is believed to encourage
      competition and innovation, leading to a more dynamic economy where
      resources are allocated efficiently based on market demands.

      Substantively, the most important part of the Republican education
      platform might be its support for universal school choice. In about a
      dozen states, Republicans have recently created or expanded education
      savings account (ESA) programs that make public funds available to pay for
      private school or other educational expenses. Critics of these
      programs—myself included—argue that they violate our basic traditions,
      benefit the wealthy at the expense of others, and are not well supported
      by research.

      A shared “America first” ethos made Republicans wary of liberal
