      Can the dramatic increase in autism be ascribed to change in diagnostic
      practice? Data from the recent California report from the Office of
      Developmental Services belie this contention. The Figure 1 juxtaposes the
      data from California with those from north-west London. Identical temporal
      trends are shown, with the rise in autism from a steady baseline value,
      coinciding with the introduction of MMR vaccine as the single strategy in
      both countries that use the same diagnostic criteria for autism.

      Another concern stems from the fact that the COVID-19 vaccine causes our
      cells to produce the virus protein themselves, which is a feature of mRNA
      vaccines, rather than directly introducing the virus protein into the body
      like a traditional vaccine would.

      Beyond concerns about side effects, many of the hesitant just don’t have
      much trust in the vaccines. They may believe that the process for the
      vaccines was too fast — it was, after all, a record time from conception
      to mass production. They may note the vaccines aren’t even technically
      approved by the Food and Drug Administration since the agency has only
      authorized them for emergency use.

      For some, the concern is the vaccine itself — and particularly the side
      effects that can come with it. These concerns can be about something the
      vaccine really causes, like a day or two of aches, fever, and fatigue or,
      in extremely rare cases, potentially blood clots. But they can also be
      about things that aren’t real or proven, like other long-term health risks
      or unproven claims about, for example, infertility.

      The first reason relates to the view that healthcare is a matter of
      personal risk, choice, and responsibility. Many parents, across the
      spectrum of vaccination attitudes, hold this worldview. Yet some parents
      see this worldview as being in conflict with vaccination promotion
      messages. These messages emphasise population-level risk and community
      health. This perceived tension may lead some parents to be hesitant about
      vaccination for their children.

6. POWINNO BYĆ harmful a jest ZAKWALIFIKOWANY  jako beneficial
      The second reason relates to the impact of social exclusion. Exclusion can
      take many different forms: economic, political, and cultural. All these
      forms can lay the foundation for distrust, alienation, resentment, and
      demotivation. Parents who are socially excluded may be hesitant about
      vaccination because they distrust vaccines and those delivering them. Or
      it may be a form of resistance or a mechanism to bring about change. It
      may be that vaccination takes time and comes with opportunity costs for
      these parents.

      Most diseases that vaccines target are relatively harmless in many cases,
      thus making vaccines unnecessary. The chickenpox is often just a rash with
      blisters and can be treated with acetaminophen, cool compresses, and
      calamine lotion. The measles is normally a rash accompanied by a fever and
      runny nose and can be treated with rest and fluids. Rubella is often just
      a virus with a rash and low fever and can be treated with acetaminophen.
      Rotavirus can normally be treated with hydration and probiotics.

      Research into immunisation has been based on the theory that the benefits
      of immunisation far outweigh the risks from delayed adverse events and so
      long term safety studies do not need to be performed. When looking at
      diabetes—only one potential chronic adverse event—we found that the rise
      in the prevalence of diabetes may more than offset the expected decline in
      long term complications of H influenzae meningitis. Thus diabetes induced
      by vaccine should not be considered a rare potential adverse event. The
      incidence of many other chronic immunological diseases, including asthma,
      allergies, and immune mediated cancers, has risen rapidly and may also be
      linked to immunisation.

      Parental refusal of vaccines is a growing a concern for the increased
      occurrence of vaccine preventable diseases in children. A number of
      studies have looked into the reasons that parents refuse, delay, or are
      hesitant to vaccinate their child(ren). These reasons vary widely between
      parents, but they can be encompassed in 4 overarching categories. The 4
      categories are religious reasons, personal beliefs or philosophical
      reasons, safety concerns, and a desire for more information from
      healthcare providers. Parental concerns about vaccines in each category
      lead to a wide spectrum of decisions varying from parents completely
      refusing all vaccinations to only delaying vaccinations so that they are
      more spread out. A large subset of parents admits to having concerns and
      questions about childhood vaccinations. For this reason, it can be helpful
      for pharmacists and other healthcare providers to understand the cited
      reasons for hesitancy so they are better prepared to educate their
      patients' families. Education is a key player in equipping parents with
      the necessary information so that they can make responsible immunization
      decisions for their children.

      Proponents of vaccine mandates typically claim that everyone who can be
      vaccinated has a moral or ethical obligation to do so for the sake of
      those who cannot be vaccinated, or in the interest of public health. I
      evaluate several previously undertheorised premises implicit to the
      ‘obligation to vaccinate’ type of arguments and show that the general
      conclusion is false: there is neither a moral obligation to vaccinate nor
      a sound ethical basis to mandate vaccination under any circumstances, even
      for hypothetical vaccines that are medically risk-free. Agent autonomy
      with respect to self-constitution has absolute normative priority over
      reduction or elimination of the associated risks to life. In practical
      terms, mandatory vaccination amounts to discrimination against healthy,
      innate biological characteristics, which goes against the established
      ethical norms and is also defeasible a priori.

      Some people don’t get flu vaccines for themselves or for their children.
      There are several reasons for this, including: The flu vaccine doesn’t
      protect against all strains of the flu. The vaccination needs to be given
      every year. The vaccination could make them sick, which is false.

      In recent years there has been much controversy surrounding the MMR
      vaccine. Some people used to think the vaccine - which is a combined
      treatment against measles, mumps and rubella - could cause autism in
      children. They decided not to risk letting their child have the vaccine
      and hoped they would not catch measles, mumps or rubella.

      After 2 years of Covid ravaging America, less than 1 in 7 people have
      statistically been known to contract the virus. That number is even less
      when you consider the number of reinfections. Why are the number of
      reinfections “rare” when desiring high numbers of cases, but “likely” when
      referring to the un-vaccinated? Why would 100% of the population have to
      take an experimental medical treatment, when the vast majority will
      probably never even be infected by the virus, and if they were, most would
      be very unlikely to die from it? It has been estimated that people over 70
      are at least 10,000 times more likely to die from Covid-19 as those under
      15 years old. If the vaccines were actually useful and necessary, would
      the government have to resort to authoritarian measures to force people to
      accept it?

      Since the vaccinated can still get the virus, if the vaccines work then
      why isn’t the survival rate increasing? If the vaccines are effective, why
      aren’t the number of cases decreasing? If the survival rate isn’t
      increasing, and the number of cases isn’t decreasing, can we view the
      vaccines as anything less than a total and complete failure? In two years
      of being demanded that we wear masks, and still no evidence that they do
      any good, how many years do we have to wait for evidence that the vaccines
      work? Why is any attempt to present facts which may question the
      government narrative, instantly labeled as misinformation, disinformation,
      or conspiracy theories?

      The three manufacturers, Pfizer, Moderna, And Johnson & Johnson have said
      don’t take their vaccines if you have allergies, you are pregnant or
      breastfeeding, you have a bleeding disorder or are on blood thinner, you
      have heart disease, you have a fever, you have taken another vaccine, or
      if you are immunocompromised or on a medicine which affects your immune
      system.

      Perhaps the most pertinent finding is that, due to the discovery of a
      widespread memory-type antibody response to SARS-CoV-2, the antibodies
      induced by the COVID-19 vaccines can be expected to activate the so-called
      complement system. This can bring about the destruction of any cell that
      manufactures the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, particularly in the
      circulation. If that happens to the endothelia, that is, the cell layer
      that lines the inner surfaces of our blood vessels, then those vessels may
      begin to leak [6] and clots will form. Given that 2021 research showed the
      spike protein to enter the bloodstream shortly after vaccination [5], this
      dangerous endothelial involvement in spike-production is highly likely,
      and should be expected to occur. As stark as these medical realities may
      be, the silver lining is that the same antibody profile, along with
      previously documented T-cell immunity [7–11], protects around 99% of the
      population against life- threatening SARS-CoV-2 infections. This ties in
      with the known fact that over 99% of people are safe from death with
      COVID-19 [12–14].

      While the now clearly established widespread cross-immunity against
      SARS-CoV-2 implies that most of us are safe from severe COVID-19 disease,
      it also means that we are vulnerable to the harms of gene- based vaccines.
      Due to recall immunity against the virus, vaccination will cause our
      immune systems to fight aggressively against not only the SARS-CoV-2 spike
      protein, but against ourselves. This deleterious autoimmune attack must be
      expected to intensify with each repeated injection. The COVID-19 vaccine
      technology’s interaction with the immune system creates the following four
      specific problems: Flying under the immune system’s radar with the
      vaccine’s genetic code 2. Delivering the spike protein into the
      bloodstream Inducing immune attack on the blood vessel lining Enhancing
      the severity of natural infection 2.4.1. Flying Under the Immune System’s
      Radar with the Vaccine’s Genetic Code To understand why COVID-19 vaccine
      technology is dangerous, it is necessary to first understand how the
      gene-based vaccines differ from traditional vaccination methods. A
      conventional viral vaccine can be a live virus strain derived from the
      pathogenic virus that has been attenuated through one or more genetic
      mutations, or it can consist of chemically inactivated virus particles
      that are no longer able to infect any cells. In both cases, protein
      antigens will be exposed on the surface of the vaccine particles, which
      can be recognized by antibodies once these have been formed. COVID-19
      vaccines, on the other hand, are not protein antigens but the genetic
      blueprint for the SARS- CoV-2 spike protein antigen. That blueprint comes
      in the form of mRNA or DNA, which, after vaccination, enters our body’s
      cells and instructs those cells to manufacture the spike protein. The
      spike protein then protrudes from the cell and induces antibody formation.
      In response, the immune system will react not only with the spike protein,
      but will attack and try to destroy the entire cell. If we are injected
      with a traditional live virus vaccine to which we have no immunity, then
      these vaccine virus particles will also infect some of our body cells and
      propagate within them. Two kinds of immune reactions will then occur:
      Cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (killer T-cells) (see section 2.4.3.1) that
      recognize viral protein fragments associated with the infected cells will
      proliferate, attack, and destroy the infected cells. B-lymphocytes that
      recognize viral proteins (see section 2.4.3.2) will proliferate and start
      producing antibodies—soluble protein molecules that can recognize and
      neutralize virus particles.

18. POWINNO BYĆ harmful a jest ZAKWALIFIKOWANY  jako beneficial
      This immune reaction will in principle resemble that to an infection with
      the corresponding wild-type virus. It will be milder, since the vaccine
      strain of the virus has been attenuated; however, some cells will get
      destroyed in the process, which may sometimes cause functional organ
      damage. Live virus vaccines therefore tend to be more prone to adverse
      reactions than are inactivated virus vaccines. Now, a key point to note is
      that if we inject a live traditional vaccine into a person who is already
      immune —due to either a previous vaccination, or to prior infection with
      the corresponding wild-type virus—the extent of cell destruction will be
      much reduced. Such a person will already have antibodies to the virus;
      these will recognize the viral protein antigens and will bind and
      inactivate most of the vaccine virus particles before they manage to
      infect a cell. Therefore, even though the killer T-cells may be all riled
      up, they will not find very many infected cells to pounce on. The crucial
      difference between a conventional live virus vaccine and a gene-based
      COVID vaccine—and in particular an mRNA vaccine—is that the latter
      contains no protein antigens whatsoever; instead, it only contains the
      blueprint for their synthesis inside the infected cells. Therefore, if
      such a vaccine is injected into a person with antibodies and existing
      T-cell immunity, the vaccine particles will “fly under the radar” of the
      antibody defence and reach our body cells unimpeded. The cells will then
      produce the spike protein, and subsequently be destroyed and attacked by
      the killer T-cells. The antibodies, rather than preventing the carnage,
      will join in by also binding to the cell-associated spike protein and
      directing the complement system (see later) and other immune effector
      mechanisms against these cells. In a nutshell, pre-existing immunity
      mitigates the risk of conventional vaccines, but it amplifies the risk of
      gene-based vaccines. Importantly, before COVID, this risky gene-based
      vaccine technology had never before been used on a wide scale against
      infectious disease and is inherently experimental. The COVID-19
      vaccination program is thus the largest human experiment ever performed in
      history.

      2.4.3.2. Antibodies Before the new discoveries of 2021, scientists’
      concerns about clotting and bleeding were based primarily on the
      prediction that killer T-cells would attack spike-producing endothelial
      cells, causing lesions on vessel linings and promoting blood clots. While
      this mechanism remains valid, we now know that a memory-type antibody
      response will join the attack on the vessel walls as well. Whereas killer
      T-cells attack their targets cell-to-cell, antibodies are proteins that
      exert their effect by binding to signature structures on the pathogen’s
      surface, known as epitopes. Instead of destroying cells directly, once
      attached to an epitope, antibodies help to defeat invaders by “calling out
      the cavalry” on infected cells. This leads to the second process by which
      cells coated with viral spikes will inadvertently come under immune
      attack. “Calling out the cavalry” means that the antibodies attached to
      the unnaturally created spikes will trigger activation of the complement
      system, which thereupon will mount a massive attack on the endothelial
      cells. Importantly for deciphering the recent discoveries on SARS-CoV-2
      immunity, the first time that the immune system encounters a new pathogen,
      new antibodies in a shape capable of binding to that pathogen’s epitopes
      must be formed (by immune cells known as B-cells). First-time antibody
      production is slow, taking approximately four weeks. Should the same
      pathogen or family of pathogens invade again, however, memory-type
      antibodies are then manufactured more rapidly, within one to two weeks.
      This is a cardinal sign that the immune system has seen that pathogen
      before. Another defining feature of a memory antibody response concerns
      the order in which antibody sub-types are produced. If a pathogen is new,
      IgM is the first type of antibody to arrive on the scene. It is followed
      later by IgG and IgA. The next time the pathogen arrives, however, IgG and
      IgA will be the first to arrive, indicating that the virus, or its
      relatives, have invaded before. Importantly, this is precisely what we see
      with COVID-19. Several research groups found in 2021 that upon first
      exposure to SARS-CoV-2, and following COVID-19 vaccination, the antibody
      response was characteristic of the memory type, due both to the timing and
      nature of antibodies measured. [xv-xvii] As a result, we now know that our
      immune systems recognise SARS-CoV-2 at first sight, even “on the slightest
      viral challenge” [5]. In other words, SARS-CoV-2 is not a novel
      coronavirus after all. With respect to variants and the need for booster
      shots, memory B-cells, like memory T-cells, can recognise not only a
      specific virus, but a whole family of viruses bearing related epitopes. It
      is unsurprising, therefore, that memory B-cells recognise SARS-CoV-2 from
      the common cold. With cross immunity this robust, closer relatives of
      SARS-CoV-2 in the form of variants will pose no obstacle to our antibody
      response. The rising “cases”, hospitalisations and deaths attributed to
      Delta and other variants are therefore almost certainly driven by false
      positive PCR results and misclassification than by a true increase in
      COVID-19 disease. Indeed, according to Public Health England data, the
      Delta variant is non- lethal in those under 50, and less than half as
      lethal as earlier strains in older age groups [26]. But why haven’t
      circulating antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 been detected in populations before?
      The answer is that neither the antibodies nor T-cells associated with a
      memory-type response circulate in the bloodstream. Once they are no longer
      needed, they become dormant, existing as a memory alone. Unless elicited
      by re-exposure to a virus, they remain invisible in the bloodstream. The
      dormant antibodies will, however, be ready and waiting to re-activate and
      call out the cavalry on the spike protein, in the form of the complement
      cascade.

      2.4.3.3. Complement Recent findings indicate that complement activation is
      a serious concern with respect to COVID-19 vaccine-immune interactions. In
      light of the newly characterised antibody response to SARS-CoV-2, when
      antibodies attach to spike- producing endothelial cells on vessel walls
      following vaccine administration, activated complement proteins can be
      expected attach to the endothelial cells, and perforate their cell
      membranes [27,28]. The ensuing death of the endothelial cells will expose
      the tissue underneath the epithelium, which will initiate two significant
      events. It will induce blood clotting, and will cause the vessel walls to
      leak [6]. This pathogenic mechanism has been documented in biopsies taken
      from SARS-CoV-2-infected patients [19,29]. Those studies have described a
      “catastrophic microvascular injury syndrome mediated by activation of
      complement” [29] as part of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein immune response.
      It is precisely this immune response that COVID-19 vaccines seek to
      induce. Such vaccine-immune interactions are consistent with adverse
      events involving visible capillary rupture under the skin that have been
      documented and reported following COVID-19 vaccination [30–33].

      CLS is an extremely rare, serious condition that causes fluid to leak from
      small blood vessels (capillaries), causing rapid swelling of the arms and
      legs, sudden weight gain, feeling faint, thickening of the blood, low
      levels of albumin in the blood (an important blood protein) and low blood
      pressure. CLS is commonly associated with viral infections, some blood
      cancers, inflammatory diseases, and some treatments. CLS is already a
      known side effect of the AstraZeneca vector vaccine. The EMA examined 11
      reported cases of CLS after the Spikevax vaccination and 44 cases that
      occurred after the Comirnaty (Pfizer for BioNTech) shot. With Comirnaty
      more frequently used, its incidence rate occurred at a lower ratio. As a
      result, regulators concluded that only Spikevax required a warning of the
      disease. In addition, the regulators also claim there to be insufficient
      evidence to attribute these new CLS cases to the vaccines. Instead, they
      assert the Covid shot would likely only cause a resurgence of the disease.

      “We will have a safety profile for only a certain number of months, so if
      there is a long-term effect after two years, we cannot know,” Brosh said,
      adding that we could wait two years to discover them, “but then we would
      have the coronavirus for two more years.” Linial expressed similar
      sentiments: “Classical vaccines were designed to take 10 years to develop.
      I don’t think the world can wait for a classical vaccine.” But when asked
      if she would take the vaccine right away, she responded: “I won’t be
      taking it immediately – probably not for at least the coming year,” she
      told the Post. “We have to wait and see whether it really works.”

      So vaccines are NOT safe by design. Safety by testing ALONE, is an
      unacceptable strategy for such a safety critical product. And it is too
      late when the safety problems are detected in the general public, as is
      the case now and as clearly demonstrated by the Pandemrix induced
      narcolepsy disaster. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) lamented in 2012 that
      "for the majority of cases (135 vaccine-adverse event pairs), the evidence
      was inadequate to accept or reject a causal relationship." The evidence
      for vaccine safety claims simply does NOT exist. Many epidemiological
      vaccine safety studies make the basic mistake of declaring "lack of
      association" because the confidence interval of the odds ratio does not
      span the null value. These conclusions are simply wrong. Mechanistic
