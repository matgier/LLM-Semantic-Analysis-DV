      One vaccine ingredient that has been studied specifically is thimerosal.
      Thimerosal is a mercury-based preservative used to prevent germs (like
      bacteria and fungi) from contaminating multidose vials of vaccines.
      Research shows that thimerosal does not cause ASD. In fact, a 2004
      scientific review by the IOM concluded that "the evidence favors rejection
      of a causal relationship between thimerosal–containing vaccines and
      autism."

      But clinical trial results demonstrate the vaccine’s safety in young
      children. Research published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM)
      and funded by BNT162b2 makers Pfizer and BioNTech found no serious
      vaccine-related adverse effects among the 1517 fully vaccinated 5- to
      11-year-old participants. After a median 2.3-month follow-up, the
      researchers concluded that BNT162b2 is safe, immunogenic, and effective
      for the young age group they studied.

      Some people have had concerns that ASD might be linked to the vaccines
      children receive, but studies have shown that there is no link between
      receiving vaccines and developing ASD. The National Academy of Medicine,
      formerly known as Institute of Medicine, reviewed the safety of 8 vaccines
      to children and adults. The review found that with rare exceptions, these
      vaccines are very safe.

      Based on the extensive review presented, GACVS concluded that no evidence
      exists of a causal association between MMR vaccine and autism or autistic
      disorders. The Committee believes the matter is likely to be clarified by
      a better understanding of the causes of autism. GACVS also concluded that
      there is no evidence to support the routine use of monovalent measles,
      mumps and rubella vaccines over the combined vaccine, a strategy which
      would put children at increased risk of incomplete immunization. Thus,
      GACVS recommends that there should be no change in current vaccination
      practices with MMR.

      Most diseases that vaccines target are relatively harmless in many cases,
      thus making vaccines unnecessary. The chickenpox is often just a rash with
      blisters and can be treated with acetaminophen, cool compresses, and
      calamine lotion. The measles is normally a rash accompanied by a fever and
      runny nose and can be treated with rest and fluids. Rubella is often just
      a virus with a rash and low fever and can be treated with acetaminophen.
      Rotavirus can normally be treated with hydration and probiotics.

      Vaccinated individuals have accounted for 73 percent of all covid-19 cases
      in England over the past month and are the obvious driving factor for
      viral transmission. The vaccinated are also the ones crowding the
      hospitals. There were 2,341 unvaccinated hospitalizations last month (a
      number that is falling rapidly). However, there were 6,889
      hospitalizations for the vaccinated (a number that is rapidly increasing).
      Most of these hospitalizations are occurring in triply vaccinated
      individuals (4,936). In all, 75 percent of all Covid-19 hospitalizations
      are observed in the vaccinated. When it comes to fatalities, the
      unvaccinated cohort is improving. The unvaccinated accounted for 559
      deaths in the last reporting period and the vaccinated accounted for 4,302
      deaths, with the majority of fatalities occurring in the triply vaccinated
      (3,120). The vaccinated population now accounts for 90 percent of the
      deaths overall. The triply vaccinated account for 4 of every 5 of these
      fatalities! To put these figures in perspective, take a look at the Week
      51 Vaccine Surveillance Report for 2021. From November 22 to December 19,
      2021, there were 889 unvaccinated deaths and 2,913 vaccinated deaths. This
      shows that the fatality rate for the unvaccinated population is going
      down, while the fatality rate for the vaccinated population is getting
      severely worse. So, why hasn’t a strict moratorium been placed on this
      destructive vaccine?

      Thalidomide is a drug that was marketed as a treatment for morning
      sickness in pregnant women in the late 1950s and early 60s and later
      caused birth defects. This has understandably prompted distrust in
      government guidance on public health issues. However, Thalidomide is not
      comparable to a vaccine. Thalidomide went directly into the bloodstream,
      whereas the Covid-19 vaccine gives antibodies which help fight off the
      virus. Thalidomide was not properly tested and never went through the
      monitoring system as the coronavirus vaccine has done. Dr Ruth Blue, a
      consultant for the Thalidomide Society, said it was “a bit insulting that
      suddenly Thalidomide gets remembered after all these years when it suits
      anti-vaxxers to have something to compare to — but it isn’t a comparison.
      “The outcome of Thalidomide completely changed the way drugs are tested
      and are passed.” She added: “Vaccinations are a really fairly safe form of
      medicine. They have been around for a very long time. There have been very
      few problems with vaccinations over the years and it’s not really
      comparable. They are a tried and tested science and they have saved
      absolutely millions of lives. “Thalidomide did totally the opposite. It
      wasn’t tested, it wasn’t tried out and it destroyed millions of lives.”

      Parental refusal of vaccines is a growing a concern for the increased
      occurrence of vaccine preventable diseases in children. A number of
      studies have looked into the reasons that parents refuse, delay, or are
      hesitant to vaccinate their child(ren). These reasons vary widely between
      parents, but they can be encompassed in 4 overarching categories. The 4
      categories are religious reasons, personal beliefs or philosophical
      reasons, safety concerns, and a desire for more information from
      healthcare providers. Parental concerns about vaccines in each category
      lead to a wide spectrum of decisions varying from parents completely
      refusing all vaccinations to only delaying vaccinations so that they are
      more spread out. A large subset of parents admits to having concerns and
      questions about childhood vaccinations. For this reason, it can be helpful
      for pharmacists and other healthcare providers to understand the cited
      reasons for hesitancy so they are better prepared to educate their
      patients' families. Education is a key player in equipping parents with
      the necessary information so that they can make responsible immunization
      decisions for their children.

      Some people don’t get flu vaccines for themselves or for their children.

      In recent years there has been much controversy surrounding the MMR
      vaccine. Some people used to think the vaccine - which is a combined
      treatment against measles, mumps and rubella - could cause autism in
      children. They decided not to risk letting their child have the vaccine
      and hoped they would not catch measles, mumps or rubella.

      to school. But many colleges require proof of routine vaccinations. You
      may not have those records. Your parents may not have those records. And
      your childhood doctor may no longer be practicing. It’s OK to repeat a
      vaccine. But, Wharton says, it’s “a hassle and cost” that could be
      prevented by keeping good records.

      So vaccines are NOT safe by design. Safety by testing ALONE, is an
      unacceptable strategy for such a safety critical product. And it is too
      late when the safety problems are detected in the general public, as is
      the case now and as clearly demonstrated by the Pandemrix induced
      narcolepsy disaster. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) lamented in 2012 that
      "for the majority of cases (135 vaccine-adverse event pairs), the evidence
      was inadequate to accept or reject a causal relationship." The evidence
      for vaccine safety claims simply does NOT exist. Many epidemiological
      vaccine safety studies make the basic mistake of declaring "lack of
      association" because the confidence interval of the odds ratio does not
      span the null value. These conclusions are simply wrong. Mechanistic
      evidence clearly demonstrates vaccines cause food allergies, asthma⁠,
      autism and many autoimmune diseases including type 1 diabetes.

      2.4.4. Enhancing the Severity of Wild Coronavirus Infection Finally, as
      with the Dengue virus and several other viruses [34], antibodies to
      coronaviruses can ultimately aggravate rather than mitigate illness. This
      is called antibody-dependent enhancement of disease. The underlying
      mechanisms remain to be elucidated but it is already clear that the net
      effects are severely detrimental. Attempts to develop vaccines to the
      original SARS virus, which is closely related to SARS-CoV-2, repeatedly
      failed due to antibody-dependent enhancement of disease [35–37]. The
      vaccines induced antibodies, but when the vaccinated animals were
      subsequently infected with the wild-type virus, they became more ill than
      the unvaccinated animals, in some cases mortally so [38].

      “We will have a safety profile for only a certain number of months, so if
      there is a long-term effect after two years, we cannot know,” Brosh said,
      adding that we could wait two years to discover them, “but then we would
      have the coronavirus for two more years.” Linial expressed similar
      sentiments: “Classical vaccines were designed to take 10 years to develop.
      I don’t think the world can wait for a classical vaccine.” But when asked
      if she would take the vaccine right away, she responded: “I won’t be
      taking it immediately – probably not for at least the coming year,” she
      told the Post. “We have to wait and see whether it really works.”

      Pharmaceutical industry expert Professor Frank Lichtenberg estimates that
      the value of a vaccine could reach into the trillions of dollars and says
      that the need for companies to innovate now is crucial for saving lives.
      “Not only would a vaccine reduce mortality and hospitalizations, but it
      would have an incredible impact on economic activity and GDP,” says
      Lichtenberg, the Courtney C. Brown Professor of Business in the Economics
