      Can the dramatic increase in autism be ascribed to change in diagnostic
      practice? Data from the recent California report from the Office of
      Developmental Services belie this contention. The Figure 1 juxtaposes the
      data from California with those from north-west London. Identical temporal
      trends are shown, with the rise in autism from a steady baseline value,
      coinciding with the introduction of MMR vaccine as the single strategy in
      both countries that use the same diagnostic criteria for autism.

      The first reason relates to the view that healthcare is a matter of
      personal risk, choice, and responsibility. Many parents, across the
      spectrum of vaccination attitudes, hold this worldview. Yet some parents
      see this worldview as being in conflict with vaccination promotion
      messages. These messages emphasise population-level risk and community
      health. This perceived tension may lead some parents to be hesitant about
      vaccination for their children.

      The second reason relates to the impact of social exclusion. Exclusion can
      take many different forms: economic, political, and cultural. All these
      forms can lay the foundation for distrust, alienation, resentment, and
      demotivation. Parents who are socially excluded may be hesitant about
      vaccination because they distrust vaccines and those delivering them. Or
      it may be a form of resistance or a mechanism to bring about change. It
      may be that vaccination takes time and comes with opportunity costs for
      these parents.

      Some of the pros of mandatory vaccinations at work include:COVID-19
      vaccines are effective at helping protect against severe disease and death
      from variants of the virus currently circulating, including the Delta
      variant. Studies show that the vaccine is effective at keeping you from
      getting COVID-19. Getting the vaccine will also help keep you from getting
      seriously ill even if you do get the virus. A vaccinated workforce should
      help you avoid contact tracing and long quarantine periods.

      Research into immunisation has been based on the theory that the benefits
      of immunisation far outweigh the risks from delayed adverse events and so
      long term safety studies do not need to be performed. When looking at
      diabetes—only one potential chronic adverse event—we found that the rise
      in the prevalence of diabetes may more than offset the expected decline in
      long term complications of H influenzae meningitis. Thus diabetes induced
      by vaccine should not be considered a rare potential adverse event. The
      incidence of many other chronic immunological diseases, including asthma,
      allergies, and immune mediated cancers, has risen rapidly and may also be
      linked to immunisation.

      Vaccinated individuals have accounted for 73 percent of all covid-19 cases
      in England over the past month and are the obvious driving factor for
      viral transmission. The vaccinated are also the ones crowding the
      hospitals. There were 2,341 unvaccinated hospitalizations last month (a
      number that is falling rapidly). However, there were 6,889
      hospitalizations for the vaccinated (a number that is rapidly increasing).
      Most of these hospitalizations are occurring in triply vaccinated
      individuals (4,936). In all, 75 percent of all Covid-19 hospitalizations
      are observed in the vaccinated. When it comes to fatalities, the
      unvaccinated cohort is improving. The unvaccinated accounted for 559
      deaths in the last reporting period and the vaccinated accounted for 4,302
      deaths, with the majority of fatalities occurring in the triply vaccinated
      (3,120). The vaccinated population now accounts for 90 percent of the
      deaths overall. The triply vaccinated account for 4 of every 5 of these
      fatalities! To put these figures in perspective, take a look at the Week
      51 Vaccine Surveillance Report for 2021. From November 22 to December 19,
      2021, there were 889 unvaccinated deaths and 2,913 vaccinated deaths. This
      shows that the fatality rate for the unvaccinated population is going
      down, while the fatality rate for the vaccinated population is getting
      severely worse. So, why hasn’t a strict moratorium been placed on this
      destructive vaccine?

      It is true that the production of all three of the leading candidates –
      the newly-approved Pfizer/BioNTech jab, Moderna and the Oxford/AstraZeneca
      vaccine – have achieved in less than ten months what usually takes a
      decade. But, despite the speed, none of these vaccine trials have actually
      skipped any steps. Instead, some of the stages overlapped. For example,
      phase three of the trial – when tens of thousands of trial participants
      were given the jab – commenced when phase two – which saw hundreds
      receiving the vaccine – was still ongoing. At a Downing Street press
      conference on Wednesday, Dr June Raine – the head of the UK’s regulatory
      agency which has given the Pfizer treatment the thumbs up – said no
      corners have been cut. “If you’re climbing a mountain, you prepare and
      prepare. We started that in June. By the time the interim results became
      available on 10 November we were at base camp,” she said. “And then when
      we got the final analysis we were ready for that last sprint that takes us
      to today.” Vaccine trials are usually held up by long periods of inertia –
      waiting for funding, resources and permissions to come through. But,
      because of the huge global stake in ending the pandemic, there was no
      waiting game. A huge amount of funding and support were poured into
      vaccine efforts across the world – and that’s brought us to where we are
      today. As for side effects, they usually show up in trials quickly after
      vaccination – while longer-term effects are very rare. So you don’t have
      anything to worry about on that front, either.

      Thalidomide is a drug that was marketed as a treatment for morning
      sickness in pregnant women in the late 1950s and early 60s and later
      caused birth defects. This has understandably prompted distrust in
      government guidance on public health issues. However, Thalidomide is not
      comparable to a vaccine. Thalidomide went directly into the bloodstream,
      whereas the Covid-19 vaccine gives antibodies which help fight off the
      virus. Thalidomide was not properly tested and never went through the
      monitoring system as the coronavirus vaccine has done. Dr Ruth Blue, a
      consultant for the Thalidomide Society, said it was “a bit insulting that
      suddenly Thalidomide gets remembered after all these years when it suits
      anti-vaxxers to have something to compare to — but it isn’t a comparison.
      “The outcome of Thalidomide completely changed the way drugs are tested
      and are passed.” She added: “Vaccinations are a really fairly safe form of
      medicine. They have been around for a very long time. There have been very
      few problems with vaccinations over the years and it’s not really
      comparable. They are a tried and tested science and they have saved
      absolutely millions of lives. “Thalidomide did totally the opposite. It

      Parental refusal of vaccines is a growing a concern for the increased
      occurrence of vaccine preventable diseases in children. A number of
      studies have looked into the reasons that parents refuse, delay, or are
      hesitant to vaccinate their child(ren). These reasons vary widely between
      parents, but they can be encompassed in 4 overarching categories. The 4
      categories are religious reasons, personal beliefs or philosophical
      reasons, safety concerns, and a desire for more information from
      healthcare providers. Parental concerns about vaccines in each category
      lead to a wide spectrum of decisions varying from parents completely
      refusing all vaccinations to only delaying vaccinations so that they are
      more spread out. A large subset of parents admits to having concerns and
      questions about childhood vaccinations. For this reason, it can be helpful
      for pharmacists and other healthcare providers to understand the cited
      reasons for hesitancy so they are better prepared to educate their
      patients' families. Education is a key player in equipping parents with
      the necessary information so that they can make responsible immunization
      decisions for their children.

      But once the novel coronavirus was discovered and sequenced in Wuhan,
      China, everything changed, nearly overnight. Within days, mRNA coronavirus
      vaccines were being widely acknowledged as one of our best bets against
      the virus. Scientists started using the technology to develop shots — on a
      breathtakingly rapid timeline. Suddenly, it seemed, everyone wanted to
      know who was responsible for this promising technique. If Malone is right
      about one thing pertaining to the mRNA vaccines, Geall said, it's that it
      is still important to keep researching these products and answering any
      yet unanswered questions about them, in addition to improving how and when
      they're used. "Would I have preferred that there had been 15 years of
      research and safety generation through clinical trials? Absolutely," Geall
      said. "But that wasn't an option during the pandemic." So he, and all the
      other scientists interviewed for this article, got vaccinated with the
      mRNA vaccines that they, Malone, and many others helped create over a
      30-year period.

      “The first time your body sees the spike protein, it activates some immune
      system cells to begin to recognize and develop antibodies against that
      protein,” said Boslett. The response may be similar whether that first
      encounter is from infection with the virus or from the first dose of the
      vaccine. Studies of the mRNA vaccines suggest that one dose may offer
      between 50 to 80 percent protection against symptomatic COVID-19, though
      more data is needed, said Boslett. “We know you get some amount of
      protection after one dose of the vaccine or after infection with the
      virus, but we don’t know in either case how long that protection lasts,”
      she said. Some cases of reinfection have been reported after three to six
      months, so the protection from one dose of the vaccine also may wane in
      that timeframe. “However, when you get the second dose of the vaccine,
      you’re further training your immune system,” said Boslett. “You’re
      strengthening that response from the antibody-producing B cells and you’re
      also activating T memory cells that stick around for much longer.” Getting
      both doses of the vaccine means your body is shown this spike protein
      multiple times in a short duration. “So that immune response might be
      bigger, better and longer lasting than just getting the infection one
      time,” she said. Because the booster effect is so important, Boslett adds
      that this is why people who have had COVID-19 are still recommended to get
      the vaccine.

      Some vaccines, such as the measles or oral polio vaccines, contain a
      weakened form of the live virus, and in very rare cases these can cause
      disease. “But this isn’t one of those,” said Boslett. “The mRNA vaccines
      just contain a message that encodes the spike protein. It is not a live
      virus, so there’s no chance that the vaccine can give you COVID.” Some
      people may feel symptoms such as fever or muscle aches after the vaccines,
      but those are due to your body’s immune response, not an infection. “That
      is actually not a bad thing because that means that your body is producing
      an inflammatory response to the vaccine, which is what we want.”

      Recent data suggest COVID-19 vaccines become less effective at preventing
      infection or severe illness over time, especially for people ages 65 years
      and older. This is why booster shots are recommended for people ages 12
      years and older who have completed their primary vaccination series.
      However, even as the vaccine’s ability to prevent infection decreases with
      time, COVID-19 vaccination continues to reduce the risk of hospitalization
      and death when people become infected with COVID-19.

      Even if you’ve had COVID-19, experts recommend getting vaccinated — and
      boosted, if you’re eligible. One reason: It’s unclear how long you are
      protected from the disease after a previous infection. Another reason: New
      research suggests that the COVID-19 vaccines offer better protection than
      natural immunity and can help prevent reinfections.

      So vaccines are NOT safe by design. Safety by testing ALONE, is an
      unacceptable strategy for such a safety critical product. And it is too
      late when the safety problems are detected in the general public, as is
      the case now and as clearly demonstrated by the Pandemrix induced

      "for the majority of cases (135 vaccine-adverse event pairs), the evidence
      was inadequate to accept or reject a causal relationship." The evidence
      for vaccine safety claims simply does NOT exist. Many epidemiological
      vaccine safety studies make the basic mistake of declaring "lack of
