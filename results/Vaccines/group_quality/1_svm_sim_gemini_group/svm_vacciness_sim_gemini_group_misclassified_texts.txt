      That’s how health journalist Helen Branswell recently described the
      vaccines that have saved millions of lives in the coronavirus pandemic.
      The vaccines, offered to the U.S. population, have proved to be 90 percent
      effective against infection. Ready within a year of the outbreak, they
      have proved to be safe. And they are widely available and free. There is
      no parallel in modern times. According to the Centers for Disease Control
      and Prevention, about 1 in 5 eligible Americans have yet to get their
      first vaccine dose. Millions of people remain unvaccinated. They were 14
      times more likely than the vaccinated to die of covid, as of December, the
      latest month for which data is available. How many of the 551,168 covid
      deaths in the United States since Jan. 1, 2021, could have been averted
      with vaccines? Too many. No more powerful case can be made than the voices
      of those who hesitated to get vaccinated and then faced the awful
      consequences.

      “The first time your body sees the spike protein, it activates some immune
      system cells to begin to recognize and develop antibodies against that
      protein,” said Boslett. The response may be similar whether that first
      encounter is from infection with the virus or from the first dose of the
      vaccine. Studies of the mRNA vaccines suggest that one dose may offer
      between 50 to 80 percent protection against symptomatic COVID-19, though
      more data is needed, said Boslett. “We know you get some amount of
      protection after one dose of the vaccine or after infection with the
      virus, but we don’t know in either case how long that protection lasts,”
      she said. Some cases of reinfection have been reported after three to six
      months, so the protection from one dose of the vaccine also may wane in
      that timeframe. “However, when you get the second dose of the vaccine,
      you’re further training your immune system,” said Boslett. “You’re
      strengthening that response from the antibody-producing B cells and you’re
      also activating T memory cells that stick around for much longer.” Getting
      both doses of the vaccine means your body is shown this spike protein
      multiple times in a short duration. “So that immune response might be
      bigger, better and longer lasting than just getting the infection one
      time,” she said. Because the booster effect is so important, Boslett adds
      that this is why people who have had COVID-19 are still recommended to get
      the vaccine.

      Vaccine trials often take years because not only do they need to recruit a
      lot of participants to be able to evaluate safety and efficacy, they then
      need to wait for natural infections to take place. The COVID-19 vaccine
      trials have moved along faster thanks to extra financial support from the
      government and other funding sources, and the high prevalence of the virus
      in the community, said Boslett. “They didn’t skip any steps.” More than
      40,000 people were enrolled in the Pfizer vaccine trials, and more than
      30,000 in the Moderna vaccine trials. “That’s a lot of people, but if the
      virus were rare, that still wouldn’t be enough people,” said Boslett. “But
      because the virus is running so rampant throughout the U.S. and other
      places in the world, this was actually a good number of people to show a
      difference between the vaccinated and unvaccinated groups.” The mRNA
      technology, which has undergone years of study for other potential
      vaccines, was another time-saver. Compared to vaccines that use live
      viruses, mRNA vaccines are relatively easy to manufacture. “Virus is
      actually hard to grow,” said Boslett. “The fact that this wasn’t a live
      vaccine allowed the manufacturing to be a little bit simpler.”

      Some vaccines, such as the measles or oral polio vaccines, contain a
      weakened form of the live virus, and in very rare cases these can cause
      disease. “But this isn’t one of those,” said Boslett. “The mRNA vaccines
      just contain a message that encodes the spike protein. It is not a live
      virus, so there’s no chance that the vaccine can give you COVID.” Some
      people may feel symptoms such as fever or muscle aches after the vaccines,
      but those are due to your body’s immune response, not an infection. “That
      is actually not a bad thing because that means that your body is producing
      an inflammatory response to the vaccine, which is what we want.”

      A vaccine’s efficacy is measured in a controlled clinical trial and is
      based on how many people who got vaccinated developed the ‘outcome of
      interest’ (usually disease) compared with how many people who got the
      placebo (dummy vaccine) developed the same outcome. Once the study is
      complete, the numbers of sick people in each group are compared, in order
      to calculate the relative risk of getting sick depending on whether or not
      the subjects received the vaccine. From this we get the efficacy – a
      measure of how much the vaccine lowered the risk of getting sick. If a
      vaccine has high efficacy, a lot fewer people in the group who received
      the vaccine got sick than the people in the group who received the
      placebo. So, for example, let’s imagine a vaccine with a proven efficacy
      of 80%. This means that – out of the people in the clinical trial – those
      who received the vaccine were at a 80% lower risk of developing disease
      than the group who received the placebo. This is calculated by comparing
      the number of cases of disease in the vaccinated group versus the placebo
      group. An efficacy of 80% does not mean that 20% of the vaccinated group
      will become ill.

      Can the dramatic increase in autism be ascribed to change in diagnostic
      practice? Data from the recent California report from the Office of
      Developmental Services belie this contention. The Figure 1 juxtaposes the
      data from California with those from north-west London. Identical temporal
      trends are shown, with the rise in autism from a steady baseline value,
      coinciding with the introduction of MMR vaccine as the single strategy in
      both countries that use the same diagnostic criteria for autism.

      When you are vaccinated against COVID-19, you not only protect yourself,
      but also those around you. Even if you are fit and healthy and have a
      lower risk of becoming severely ill from COVID-19, you might pass the
      virus on to a more vulnerable person if you become infected. You may not
      know which people in your life are more vulnerable to disease and death
      from COVID-19: an elderly parent or a friend undergoing chemotherapy are
      obviously at higher risk, but we don’t always know what risk factors
      affect others. Getting vaccinated helps keep your friends and family safe.
      As more people get vaccinated, everyone is better protected against future
      outbreaks. Everyone can help reduce the impact and spread of COVID-19.
      Your decision to get vaccinated matters.

      Recent data suggest COVID-19 vaccines become less effective at preventing
      infection or severe illness over time, especially for people ages 65 years
      and older. This is why booster shots are recommended for people ages 12
      years and older who have completed their primary vaccination series.
      However, even as the vaccine’s ability to prevent infection decreases with
      time, COVID-19 vaccination continues to reduce the risk of hospitalization
      and death when people become infected with COVID-19.

      Even if you’ve had COVID-19, experts recommend getting vaccinated — and
      boosted, if you’re eligible. One reason: It’s unclear how long you are
      protected from the disease after a previous infection. Another reason: New
      research suggests that the COVID-19 vaccines offer better protection than
      natural immunity and can help prevent reinfections.

      Vaccines do not give you a disease. Instead, they teach your body's immune
      system to recognise and fight the infection they have been designed to
      protect against. Some people do experience mild to moderate symptoms after
      being vaccinated. This is not the disease itself, but the body's response
      to the vaccine. Common reactions that may affect more than one in 10
      people and typically get better within days include chills, tiredness and
      aching muscles.

      But clinical trial results demonstrate the vaccine’s safety in young
      children. Research published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM)
      and funded by BNT162b2 makers Pfizer and BioNTech found no serious
      vaccine-related adverse effects among the 1517 fully vaccinated 5- to
      11-year-old participants. After a median 2.3-month follow-up, the
      researchers concluded that BNT162b2 is safe, immunogenic, and effective
      for the young age group they studied.

      The first reason relates to the view that healthcare is a matter of
      personal risk, choice, and responsibility. Many parents, across the
      spectrum of vaccination attitudes, hold this worldview. Yet some parents
      see this worldview as being in conflict with vaccination promotion
      messages. These messages emphasise population-level risk and community
      health. This perceived tension may lead some parents to be hesitant about
      vaccination for their children.

      Some people have had concerns that ASD might be linked to the vaccines
      children receive, but studies have shown that there is no link between
      receiving vaccines and developing ASD. The National Academy of Medicine,
      formerly known as Institute of Medicine, reviewed the safety of 8 vaccines
      to children and adults. The review found that with rare exceptions, these
      vaccines are very safe.

      Vaccines protect future generations. Vaccinated mothers protect their
      unborn children from viruses that could potentially cause birth defects,
      and vaccinated communities can help eradicate diseases for future
      generations. Before the rubella vaccine was licensed in 1969, a global
      rubella (German measles) outbreak caused the deaths of 11,000 babies, and
      birth defects in 20,000 babies between 1963 and 1965 in the United States.

      Most diseases that vaccines target are relatively harmless in many cases,
      thus making vaccines unnecessary. The chickenpox is often just a rash with
      blisters and can be treated with acetaminophen, cool compresses, and
      calamine lotion. The measles is normally a rash accompanied by a fever and
      runny nose and can be treated with rest and fluids. Rubella is often just
      a virus with a rash and low fever and can be treated with acetaminophen.
      Rotavirus can normally be treated with hydration and probiotics.

      Vaccines are considered to be safe. They’re rigorously tested and go
      through many rounds of study, examination, and research before they’re
      used with the general public. The overwhelming bulk of research and
      evidence shows that vaccines are safe and that side effects are rare. Side
      effects that do occur are typically mild.

      Vaccination is one of the most successful public health interventions in
      reducing disease spread, preventing complications and even deaths from
      vaccine preventable diseases. The success of vaccines in reducing disease
      should not suggest that vaccine preventable diseases are no longer a
      threat. Even though immunizations have significantly reduced vaccine
      preventable diseases, there were nearly 7,800 reports of vaccine
      preventable diseases in South Carolina in 2016.

      vaccines are effective at helping protect against severe disease and death
      from variants of the virus currently circulating, including the Delta
      variant. Studies show that the vaccine is effective at keeping you from
      getting COVID-19. Getting the vaccine will also help keep you from getting
      seriously ill even if you do get the virus. A vaccinated workforce should
      help you avoid contact tracing and long quarantine periods.

      COVID-19 vaccines have been shown to be safe and effective. Rigorous
      testing has demonstrated the safety of the COVID-19 vaccines and the
      Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) continue to monitor for
      safety concerns. All available vaccines are effective at preventing severe
      disease, hospitalization and death caused by COVID-19.

      Vaccines can have side effects, that is a fact. But they may only be used
      if they have been extensively tested for safety by independent
      organisations. In the past there have been harmful side effects, but these
      were rare and did not outweigh the protection provided by the vaccines.
      Nowadays, researchers understand much better how vaccines exactly work.
      Therefore, modern vaccines are much safer than those in the past.

      If we take one of these licensed vaccines, we not only protect ourselves.
      We also protect each other, because we cannot infect our family, friends
      and colleagues anymore. This is not just an opinion in the discussion on
      vaccination. It is the conclusion of the best experts in Europe and
      elsewhere.

      Research into immunisation has been based on the theory that the benefits
      of immunisation far outweigh the risks from delayed adverse events and so
      long term safety studies do not need to be performed. When looking at
      diabetes—only one potential chronic adverse event—we found that the rise
      in the prevalence of diabetes may more than offset the expected decline in
      long term complications of H influenzae meningitis. Thus diabetes induced
      by vaccine should not be considered a rare potential adverse event. The
      incidence of many other chronic immunological diseases, including asthma,
      allergies, and immune mediated cancers, has risen rapidly and may also be
      linked to immunisation.

      Any vaccine can cause side effects. Usually, these side effects are minor
      — a low-grade fever, fussiness and soreness at the injection site. Some
      vaccines cause a temporary headache, fatigue or loss of appetite. Rarely,
      a child might experience a severe allergic reaction or a neurological side
      effect, such as a seizure. Although these rare side effects are a concern,
      the risk of a vaccine causing serious harm or death is extremely small.
      The benefits of getting a vaccine are much greater than the possible side
      effects for almost all children.

      Vaccinated individuals have accounted for 73 percent of all covid-19 cases
      in England over the past month and are the obvious driving factor for
      viral transmission. The vaccinated are also the ones crowding the
      hospitals. There were 2,341 unvaccinated hospitalizations last month (a
      number that is falling rapidly). However, there were 6,889
      hospitalizations for the vaccinated (a number that is rapidly increasing).
      Most of these hospitalizations are occurring in triply vaccinated
      individuals (4,936). In all, 75 percent of all Covid-19 hospitalizations
      are observed in the vaccinated. When it comes to fatalities, the
      unvaccinated cohort is improving. The unvaccinated accounted for 559
      deaths in the last reporting period and the vaccinated accounted for 4,302
      deaths, with the majority of fatalities occurring in the triply vaccinated
      (3,120). The vaccinated population now accounts for 90 percent of the
      deaths overall. The triply vaccinated account for 4 of every 5 of these
      fatalities! To put these figures in perspective, take a look at the Week
      51 Vaccine Surveillance Report for 2021. From November 22 to December 19,
      2021, there were 889 unvaccinated deaths and 2,913 vaccinated deaths. This
      shows that the fatality rate for the unvaccinated population is going
      down, while the fatality rate for the vaccinated population is getting
      severely worse. So, why hasn’t a strict moratorium been placed on this
      destructive vaccine?

      It is true that the production of all three of the leading candidates –
      the newly-approved Pfizer/BioNTech jab, Moderna and the Oxford/AstraZeneca
      vaccine – have achieved in less than ten months what usually takes a
      decade. But, despite the speed, none of these vaccine trials have actually
      skipped any steps. Instead, some of the stages overlapped. For example,
      phase three of the trial – when tens of thousands of trial participants
      were given the jab – commenced when phase two – which saw hundreds
      receiving the vaccine – was still ongoing. At a Downing Street press
      conference on Wednesday, Dr June Raine – the head of the UK’s regulatory
      agency which has given the Pfizer treatment the thumbs up – said no
      corners have been cut. “If you’re climbing a mountain, you prepare and
      prepare. We started that in June. By the time the interim results became
      available on 10 November we were at base camp,” she said. “And then when
      we got the final analysis we were ready for that last sprint that takes us
      to today.” Vaccine trials are usually held up by long periods of inertia –
      waiting for funding, resources and permissions to come through. But,
      because of the huge global stake in ending the pandemic, there was no
      waiting game. A huge amount of funding and support were poured into
      vaccine efforts across the world – and that’s brought us to where we are
      today. As for side effects, they usually show up in trials quickly after
      vaccination – while longer-term effects are very rare. So you don’t have
      anything to worry about on that front, either.

      Thalidomide is a drug that was marketed as a treatment for morning
      sickness in pregnant women in the late 1950s and early 60s and later
      caused birth defects. This has understandably prompted distrust in
      government guidance on public health issues. However, Thalidomide is not
      comparable to a vaccine. Thalidomide went directly into the bloodstream,
      whereas the Covid-19 vaccine gives antibodies which help fight off the
      virus. Thalidomide was not properly tested and never went through the
      monitoring system as the coronavirus vaccine has done. Dr Ruth Blue, a
      consultant for the Thalidomide Society, said it was “a bit insulting that
      suddenly Thalidomide gets remembered after all these years when it suits
      anti-vaxxers to have something to compare to — but it isn’t a comparison.
      “The outcome of Thalidomide completely changed the way drugs are tested
      and are passed.” She added: “Vaccinations are a really fairly safe form of
      medicine. They have been around for a very long time. There have been very
      few problems with vaccinations over the years and it’s not really
      comparable. They are a tried and tested science and they have saved
      absolutely millions of lives. “Thalidomide did totally the opposite. It
      wasn’t tested, it wasn’t tried out and it destroyed millions of lives.”

      There are unfortunate and disturbing reports that childhood vaccine

      also about resurgence of a host of other awful infectious diseases like

      Parental refusal of vaccines is a growing a concern for the increased
      occurrence of vaccine preventable diseases in children. A number of
      studies have looked into the reasons that parents refuse, delay, or are
      hesitant to vaccinate their child(ren). These reasons vary widely between
      parents, but they can be encompassed in 4 overarching categories. The 4
      categories are religious reasons, personal beliefs or philosophical
      reasons, safety concerns, and a desire for more information from
      healthcare providers. Parental concerns about vaccines in each category
      lead to a wide spectrum of decisions varying from parents completely
      refusing all vaccinations to only delaying vaccinations so that they are
      more spread out. A large subset of parents admits to having concerns and
      questions about childhood vaccinations. For this reason, it can be helpful
      for pharmacists and other healthcare providers to understand the cited
      reasons for hesitancy so they are better prepared to educate their

      The World Health Organization (WHO) not only advises that vaccines save
      lives, but also reduce transmissions. They and their partners are working
      together on tracking the pandemic, advising on critical interventions, and
      distributing vital medical supplies to those in need, thereby reducing the
      number of infected people to transmit the virus. Vaccines work by training
      and preparing the body’s natural defences, the immune system to recognize
      and fight off the viruses they target. After vaccination, if the body is
      later exposed, the body is immediately ready to destroy them, preventing
      illness.

      They add that when you get vaccinated, you are protecting yourself and
      helping to protect the whole community by slowing down the spread of the
      disease. Achieving herd or social immunity is a long-term goal. It usually

      pressure. CLS is commonly associated with viral infections, some blood
      cancers, inflammatory diseases, and some treatments. CLS is already a
      known side effect of the AstraZeneca vector vaccine. The EMA examined 11
      reported cases of CLS after the Spikevax vaccination and 44 cases that
      occurred after the Comirnaty (Pfizer for BioNTech) shot. With Comirnaty
      more frequently used, its incidence rate occurred at a lower ratio. As a
      result, regulators concluded that only Spikevax required a warning of the
      disease. In addition, the regulators also claim there to be insufficient
      evidence to attribute these new CLS cases to the vaccines. Instead, they
      assert the Covid shot would likely only cause a resurgence of the disease.

      Pharmaceutical industry expert Professor Frank Lichtenberg estimates that
      the value of a vaccine could reach into the trillions of dollars and says
      that the need for companies to innovate now is crucial for saving lives.
      “Not only would a vaccine reduce mortality and hospitalizations, but it
      would have an incredible impact on economic activity and GDP,” says
      Lichtenberg, the Courtney C. Brown Professor of Business in the Economics
      Division. “The value of a vaccine would be incredible—much larger than
      anything I think we’ve ever seen.”

      What is currently unknown is the ultimate impact of those burdens on
      future economic activity, which has been curtailed severely by social
      isolation. “That’s why, if and when a vaccine is developed, which most
      people expect to happen in the next year and a half,” Lichtenberg says,
      “the value to society will be in reducing these other burdens, and
      allowing the economy to get back to normal. Or at least a new normal.”
      Lichtenberg says it’s important that any new vaccine be fairly priced, but
      also that it is financially attractive for companies to invest heavily in
      research. “Given how valuable this would be to the world, providing
      financial incentives to industry is important,” Lichtenberg says. “We need
      to develop a safe and effective vaccine as quickly as possible.”

      “Vaccination is as important for adults as it is for children, and yet
      many adults are not optimally vaccinated,” says William Schaffner, MD,
      president of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases and chairman
      of the department of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University School
      of Medicine in Nashville. Although there has been a slight increase in
      adult vaccination rates in recent years, Melinda Wharton, MD, MPH, deputy
      director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization & Respiratory
      Diseases, says “there clearly is a gap in getting adults vaccinated.”

      child. But some vaccines require a booster if you want to remain
      protected. Protection may not be life-long for diseases like pertussis
      (whooping cough) or tetanus, which is usually given with the diphtheria
      toxoid. The CDC recommends a booster for the latter every 10 years after
      an initial childhood series.

      not have a medical reason not to receive the vaccine. Each year’s
      vaccination is designed to protect against the three or four strains of

      any of those diseases themselves -- you need them as an adult. And don’t

      50-100 times more easily to be infected by hepatitis B than by HIV. Your
      partner may not appear ill, but could be carrying the disease.

      Thalidomide is a drug that was marketed as a treatment for morning
      sickness in pregnant women in the late 1950s and early 60s and later
      caused birth defects. This has understandably prompted distrust in
      government guidance on public health issues. However, Thalidomide is not
      comparable to a vaccine. Thalidomide went directly into the bloodstream,
      whereas the Covid-19 vaccine gives antibodies which help fight off the
      virus. Thalidomide was not properly tested and never went through the
      monitoring system as the coronavirus vaccine has done. Dr Ruth Blue, a
      consultant for the Thalidomide Society, said it was “a bit insulting that
      suddenly Thalidomide gets remembered after all these years when it suits
      anti-vaxxers to have something to compare to — but it isn’t a comparison.
      “The outcome of Thalidomide completely changed the way drugs are tested
      and are passed.” She added: “Vaccinations are a really fairly safe form of
      medicine. They have been around for a very long time. There have been very
      few problems with vaccinations over the years and it’s not really
      comparable. They are a tried and tested science and they have saved
      absolutely millions of lives. “Thalidomide did totally the opposite. It
      wasn’t tested, it wasn’t tried out and it destroyed millions of lives.”

      and the body's natural immunity are not enough to fight the virus and its

      We're going to need a poncho, rain pants and boots because the natural
      immunity you have could not be enough for the latest variant. So, we are
      urging families to get vaccinated even if you had COVID-19 last year
      because we need that added layer of protection,” Dr. Stoolman said.

      Severe side effects: we would also expect to see 1 to 2 people experience
      a severe complication like TTS. The risks of TTS are higher for younger
      people, especially those under 60 years. Anyone who develops severe
      headaches and tiredness up to 30 days after the first dose should seek
      medical help immediately. It’s important to know that even if someone

      For some, the concern is the vaccine itself — and particularly the side
      effects that can come with it. These concerns can be about something the
      vaccine really causes, like a day or two of aches, fever, and fatigue or,
      in extremely rare cases, potentially blood clots. But they can also be
      about things that aren’t real or proven, like other long-term health risks
      or unproven claims about, for example, infertility.
